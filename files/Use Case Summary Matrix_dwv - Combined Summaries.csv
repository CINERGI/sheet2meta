This is more of a human problem than a technology problem, as standards are just starting to be developed to help guide people�s documentation of information. There are many people working on trying to solve this problem. Some solutions underway in the larger community: 1) Assigning DOI�s to projects and project components (e.g., datasets), and 2) Create standards among publishers so that these connections and tracking capabilities happen at the point of publication. Efforts made in their project: They are using a combination of search engines for data mining and manual searching. Manual searching is working fine for their small project (on the order of thousands of data entries), but it is not a scalable solution. As their project grows, this is likely to become a problem.;- Challenge: Data variety. Without available standards, each data center/institute uses different formats. This data variety is a challenge because all must be converted to RDF, so that they can be used by Vivo. For example, they must map time ranges into an RDF structure, and this is time-consuming. It would be nice if this process was more efficient. This is a challenge that all semantic web projects face. On the other hand, the diversity in the data formats is also beneficial. If you try to standardize everything, it takes away the value that diversity also has to offer (e.g., more opportunities for innovation).
