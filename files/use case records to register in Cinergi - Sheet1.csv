2,Leslie,"Complexity of Bed-Load Transport in Gravel Bed Streams: Data Collection, Prediction, and Analysis","ftp://bedload.byu.edu, specifically ftp://bedload.byu.edu/BYU_Bedload.xlsx","Bedload transport has long been known for its complexity. Despite decades of research,
 significant gaps of understanding exist in the ability to assess and predict bedload movement.
 This work introduces a comprehensive bedload database that is a compilation of 40 years of field
 samples; compares prediction formulae using a subset of the database; evaluates the influence of
 the armor layer on stream response to sediment input, presents a mathematically manipulation of
 the empirical Pagosa Good/Fair formula for bedload transport into a format similar to the semiempirical
 Parker Surface-Based 1990 formula; and addresses the complications of bedload
 transport by collecting bedload samples on a stream in Central Utah.
 A comprehensive review of available bedload data resulted in a publicly available
 database with more than 8,000 individual bedload samples on gravel bed streams. Each
 measurement included detailed information regarding channel, site, and hydraulic characteristics.
 A subset of this database was used to compare four calibrated (a single bedload measurement
 near bankfull discharge is used to improve prediction accuracy) and two un-calibrated bedload
 prediction formulae. The four calibrated formulae include three semi-empirical (a theoretical
 treatment adjusted to fit bedload measurements) and one empirical (solely based on regression of
 bedload measurements) formula; the two un-calibrated formulae are both semi-empirical. Of the
 formulae compared, the empirical Pagosa Good/Fair formula (a calibrated formula) provided the
 most accurate prediction results with an overall root mean square error of 6.4%, an improvement
 of several orders of magnitude over the un-calibrated formulae. The Pagosa Good/Fair formula is
 cast in a form similar to the Parker 1990 formula, suggesting that criticisms stating that the
 empirical Pagosa method lacks a theoretical basis are unfounded.",,,,,"bedload, sampling, database, bedload prediction, armor layer; channel, flow rate, bed load transport rate; grain size; slope; depth, velocity, subsurface, flood, entrenchment ratio, rosgen, sinuosity,","East Saint Louis Creek, Colorado","extracted from xlsx, peculiarly formatted",

Here we show that single storm events in a river can also be observed seismically. We analyzed the high frequency seismic noise in a reach of the Cho‐Shui (Zhuóshuˇı) River in central Taiwan and made detailed observations during individual storm events. Discharge, derived from a water level gage 4.25 km from the seismometer, is highly variable due to typhoons. We found a correlation between seismic amplitude and discharge that differs on the rising and falling limbs of three storms. During each storm, for a given discharge the amplitude of seismic waves are on average two times greater on the rising limb of the storm than on the falling limb, in both aggradational and erosional events. Clockwise hysteresis in both aggradational and erosional events implies that water turbulence, alone, is not the source of the seismic waves. If seismic wave amplitude correlates linearly with the flux of bedload, this implies a roughly two‐fold decrease in transport efficiency over the time‐scale of days during individual storms. The observed change in transport efficiency can plausibly be explained by the disturbance of bed armor during storms and subsequent reformation during the waning stages. This data highlights the potential for fluvial seismology to reveal the dynamics of bedload transport.",,,,,"discharge, water level, rating curve, seismic, storm,","Cho‐Shui (Zhuóshuˇı) River in central Taiwan.

We present results from sampling campaigns over three years which demonstrate the lithologic and hydrologic controls on fluxes and isotope compositions of major dissolved inorganic runoff constituents (dissolved nutrients, major and trace elements, 87Sr/86Sr, δD). A time series record near the Fraser mouth allows us to generate new estimates of discharge-weighted concentrations and fluxes, and an overall chemical weathering rate of 32 t km−2 y−1. The seasonal variations in dissolved inorganic species are driven by changes in hydrology, which vary in timing across the basin. The time series record of dissolved 87Sr/86Sr is of particular interest, as a consistent shift between higher (“more radiogenic”) values during spring and summer and less radiogenic values in fall and winter demonstrates the seasonal variability in source contributions throughout the basin. This seasonal shift is also quite large (0.709–0.714), with a discharge-weighted annual average of 0.7120 (2 s.d. = 0.0003). We present a mixing model which predicts the seasonal evolution of dissolved 87Sr/86Sr based on tributary compositions and water discharge. This model highlights the importance of chemical weathering fluxes from the old sedimentary bedrock of headwater drainage regions, despite their relatively small contribution to the total water flux.",,,,,,,,

We used daily sampling during the onset of the freshet in the Fraser River (southwestern Canada) in 2013 to identify rapid changes in the flux and composition of dissolved material, with a focus on dissolved organic matter (DOM). Previous time series sampling (at twice monthly frequency) of dissolved inorganic species in the Fraser River has revealed smooth seasonal transitions in concentrations of major ions and tracers of water and dissolved load sources between freshet and base flow periods. In contrast, daily sampling reveals a significant increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (200 to 550 μmol L−1) occurring over a matter of days, accompanied by a shift in DOM optical properties, indicating a transition towards higher molecular weight, more aromatic DOM composition. Comparable changes in DOM composition, but not concentration, occur at other times of year, underscoring the role of seasonal climatology in DOM cycling. A smaller data set of total and dissolved Hg concentrations also showed variability during the spring freshet period, although dissolved Hg dynamics appear to be driven by factors beyond DOM as characterized here. The time series records of DOC and particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations indicate that the Fraser River exports 0.25–0.35 % of its annual basin net primary productivity. The snowmelt-dominated hydrology, forested land cover, and minimal reservoir impoundment of the Fraser River may influence the DOC yield of the basin, which is high relative to the nearby Columbia River and of similar magnitude to that of the Yukon River to the north. Anticipated warming and decreased snowfall due to climate changes in the region may cause an overall decrease in DOM flux from the Fraser River to the coastal ocean in coming decades",,,,,,,,

Changes in arctic river discharge and chemistry provide insights into changes occurring on land and also impact the chemistry, biology, and circulation of the receiving coastal and ocean waters. Our earlier efforts, beginning in the mid-1990's, to synthesize historical information about river discharge and chemical fluxes from northern rivers to the Arctic Ocean were a mixed success. Great progress was made in compiling and analyzing long-term discharge records at the pan-arctic scale. Results were particularly striking for large Russian rivers, where discharge records dating all the way back to the 1930s allowed detection of long-term discharge increases linked to global climate change (on Publications page, see Peterson et al. 2002, McClelland et al. 2004, McClelland et al. 2006). On the other hand, our early efforts to synthesize historical biogeochemical records were hampered by sparse data availability as well as data reliability issues (on Publications page, see Holmes et al. 2000, Holmes et al. 2001, Holmes et al. 2002).",,,,,,,,
