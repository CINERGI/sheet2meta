The map consists of three components. First, in regions of young ocean crust (<67.7 Ma) the model estimate uses a half-space conduction model based on the age of the oceanic crust, since it is well known that raw data measurements are frequently influenced by significant hydrothermal circulation. Second, in other regions of data coverage the estimate is based on data measurements. At the map resolution, these two categories (young ocean, data covered) cover 65% of Earth's surface. Third, for all other regions the estimate is based on the assumption that there is a correlation between heat flow and geology. This assumption is assessed and the correlation is found to provide a minor improvement over assuming that heat flow would be represented by the global average. The map is made available digitally.

The NetCDF Java library is an implementation of the CDM which can read file formats that can be accessed through the CDM data model.  The model defines a collection of objects with attributes and operations for representing and operating on datasets. The operations define an API for accessing data.
The Common Data Model has three layers, which build on top of each other to add successively richer semantics:
---The data access layer, also know as the syntactic layer, handles data reading and writing. Objects include Dataset, Group, Dimension, Attribute, Variable, Structure, Sequence, Array, ArrayStructure, StructureData, Datatype, EnumTypedef; 
---The coordinate system layer identifies the coordinates of the data arrays. Coordinates are a completely general concept for scientific data; the model includes specialized georeferencing coordinate systems. Objects include Variable, CoordinateSystem, CoordinateTransformation, ProjectionCT, VerticalCT, CoordinateAxis, and AxisType.
