http://wiki.tdwg.org/ABCD/ ","The Access to Biological Collections Data (ABCD) Schema is an evolving comprehensive standard for the access to and exchange of data about specimens and observations (a.k.a. primary biodiversity data).
The ABCD Schema attempts to be comprehensive and highly structured, supporting data from a wide variety of databases. It is compatible with several existing data standards. Parallel structures exist so that either (or both) atomised data and free-text can be accommodated. Version 1.2 is currently in use with the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and BioCASE (Biological Collection Access Service for Europe) networks.
Apart from the GBIF and BioCASE networks, the potential for the application of ABCD extends to internal networks, or in-house legacy data access (e.g. datasets from external sources that shall not be converted and integrated into an institution's own data, but be kept separately, though easily accessible). By defining relations between terms, ABCD is a step towards an ontology for biological collections.",hli,specification,data access,Operational,Biology,Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG),,,XML,,,,not explicit,XML schema,,Access to Biological Collection Data (ABCD) - version 2.06,globe.jpg,specification

This ontology's original purpose is to be integrated with other ontologies from social networking, multimedia, geography and context-awareness to aid the semi-automatic annotation of media, but more generally it can be used for Ambient Intelligence applications. For example, it can be used to capture the unique Bluetooth addresses of devices near a cameraphone at the time of photograph capture and later link those addresses to the people that own those devices. Alternatively, it can be used to track the RFID addresses of products in a factory and update their status in an information system.

Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp on them ,which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage.

Audubon Core Multimedia Resources Metadata Schema,,http://www.tdwg.org/standards/638/,"Drafted metadata vocabulary for biodiversity resources. The Audubon Core metadata schema (AC) is a representation-neutral metadata vocabulary for describing biodiversity-related multimedia resources and collections.Multimedia Resources are digital or physical artifacts which normally comprise more than text. These include pictures, artwork, drawings, photographs, sound, video, animations, presentation materials, interactive online media including identification tool packages involving text and other media. A multimedia collection is an assemblage of such objects whether curated or not and whether electronically accessible or not. For the purposes of this schema we regard a collection of multimedia resources itself as a 'multimedia resource'. Multimedia descriptions are digital records that document underlying multimedia resources. Audubon Core is focused on biodiversity-related multimedia resources. It shares terminology and concerns with many well known and important standards for describing access to resources such as Dublin Core(DC), Darwin Core (DwC), the Adobe Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP), the International Press and Telecommunications Council (IPTC) the Metadata Working Group (MWG) schema, the Natural Collections Schema (NCD), and others.

The Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) is funded by the US National Science Foundation Division of Ocean Sciences to work with ocean biogeochemistry researchers in the US to improve access to data resulting from their respective programs. In an effort to improve data access, BCO-DMO staff members are collaborating with researchers from the Tetherless World Constellation (TWC) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) to develop an ontology that formally describes the concepts and relationships in the data managed by the BCO-DMO. Version 2.0 (February 2011) of the BCO Ontology is still a work in progress. Development is ongoing, with much work still remaining to be done on the parameter class. Version 2.0 is being shared in it's current state in hopes that community members may find the work done thus far to be useful for their projects. We welcome feedback and comments on the content. Development of the ontology has been guided by a use case based approach. The use cases were derived from data access related requests received from members of the research community served by the BCO-DMO. The resultant BCO Ontology represents the information stored in the metadata database and satisfies the requirements of the use cases. The BCO-DMO metadata database currently contains information that powers several different user and machine-to-machine interfaces to the BCO-DMO data repositories. One goal of the ontology development project is to enable subsequent development of semantically-enabled components (e.g. faceted search) to enhance the power of those interfaces and improve data access through enhanced data discovery (Source: MMI)",,vocabulary,information exchange,Published Standard,Ocean Science,Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office,,,,,,,,,,Biological and Chemical Oceanography Ontology,vocabulary.jpg,vocabulary

The site is located in the centre of the Irminger Gyre, characterized by particular deep winter mixed layer depth. The mixed layer deepening is promoted through the combination of the cyclonic circulation of the Irminger gyre and strong surface buoyancy forcing in winter. Focus of the interdisciplinary research is on the biogeochemical cycling in a potential deep water formtion area. The physical background field (Temperature, Salinity, Currents) of the upper 1500m is surveyed with a number of sensors. Moreover, biogeochemical sensors (O2, Chl-a, zooplankton) is measured in mixed layer. The site area is shared with the LOCO mooring established by the NIOZ in 2002. The sampling and logistics of the moorings is coordinated with the NACLIM project. In Septmber 2014 the US OOI initiative will erect in the area the global node “Irminger Sea”.

The NetCDF Java library is an implementation of the CDM which can read file formats that can be accessed through the CDM data model.  The model defines a collection of objects with attributes and operations for representing and operating on datasets. The operations define an API for accessing data.
The Common Data Model has three layers, which build on top of each other to add successively richer semantics:
---The data access layer, also know as the syntactic layer, handles data reading and writing. Objects include Dataset, Group, Dimension, Attribute, Variable, Structure, Sequence, Array, ArrayStructure, StructureData, Datatype, EnumTypedef; 
---The coordinate system layer identifies the coordinates of the data arrays. Coordinates are a completely general concept for scientific data; the model includes specialized georeferencing coordinate systems. Objects include Variable, CoordinateSystem, CoordinateTransformation, ProjectionCT, VerticalCT, CoordinateAxis, and AxisType.
---The scientific feature type layer identifies specific types of data, such as grids, radial, and point data, adding specialized methods for each kind of data.",cicomponentREview,information model,data access,operational,,,,CDM API,,,,,,,,Common Data Model (CDM),infomrationModel.jpg,information model

Delta Format,,http://www.tdwg.org/standards/107/,"When taxonomic descriptions are prepared for input to computer programs, the form of the coding is usually dictated by the requirements of a particular program or set of programs. This restricts the type of data that can be represented, and the number of other programs that can use the data. Even when working with a particular program, it is frequently necessary to set up different versions of the same basic data, for example, when using restricted sets of taxa or characters to make special-purpose keys. The potential advantages of automation, especially in connexion with large groups, cannot be realized if the data have to be restructured by hand for every operation.
The DELTA (DEscription Language for TAxonomy) system was developed to overcome these problems. It was designed primarily for easy use by people rather than for convenience in computer programming, and is versatile enough to replace the written description as the primary means of recording data.
Consequently, it can be used as a shorthand method of recording data, even if computer processing of the data is not envisaged.",hli,specification,,Conceptual,Biology,Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG),,,,,,,,,,Delta Format,globe.jpg,specification

See SPADE2 for latest. contains soil profile characterisations with physical and chemical analyses. The initial objective was to compile data for the dominant STU in each SMU, from representative soil profile data selected by the experts in each contributing country. Initially difficulties arose because compilation of the data had begun prior to finalisation of the SMUs for the whole of Europe (some geographical coverage was added in 1995-97 after the SPADE 1 project had finished). There were other problems of data harmonisation across country boundaries and some countries, bound by confidentiality, were unable to release georeferenced data. To overcome the latter problem, the decision was made to define two different kinds of profiles, for each STU and record estimated and/or measured soil profile data depending on availability (Madsen and Jones, 1995).
The estimated soil profile data were based on expert judgement that these data are representative of the modal concept of an STU rather than a georeferenced profile. As such the estimated data are, based on the average of various observations and expert knowledge, which are essentially more appropriate. The measured soil profile data are derived directly from georeferenced soil profiles that have been described and sampled in the field, and analysed in the laboratory. For estimated profiles the analytical methods are defined to facilitate trans-national comparisons. For measured profiles, the analytical methods were coded and missing values identified.",hli,database,,AdHoc,Soil Science,European Soil Bureau (ESBN),,,,,,,,,,European Soil Profile Analytical Database (SPADE),database.jpg,database

GEMET, the GEneral Multilingual Environmental Thesaurus, has been developed as an indexing, retrieval and control tool for the European Topic Centre on Catalogue of Data Sources (ETC/CDS) and the European Environment Agency (EEA), Copenhagen. The work has been carried out through a contract between the EEA and the ETC/CDS which is led by the Ministry of the Environment of Lower Saxony, includes members of Germany, Austria, Italy, Sweden and benefits of the collaboration of other member countries of the European Union (EU), as well as of UNEP Infoterra. The basic idea for the development of GEMET was to use the best of the presently available excellent multilingual thesauri, in order to save time, energy and funds. GEMET was conceived as a ""general"" thesaurus, aimed to define a common general language, a core of general terminology for the environment. Specific thesauri and descriptor systems (e.g. on Nature Conservation, on Wastes, on Energy, etc.) have been excluded from the first step of development of the thesaurus and have been taken into account only for their structure and upper level terminology (Source: Eionet)

GeoAPI provides an interpretation and adaptation of these standards to match the expectations of Java programmers.  The GeoAPI interfaces provide a layer which separates client code, which would call the API, from library code, which implements the API. These interfaces are not an implementation.

First, in regions of young ocean crust (<67.7 Ma) the model estimate uses a half-space conduction model based on the age of the oceanic crust, since it is well known that raw data measurements are frequently influenced by significant hydrothermal circulation. Second, in other regions of data coverage the estimate is based on data measurements. At the map resolution, these two categories (young ocean, data covered) cover 65% of Earth's surface. Third, for all other regions the estimate is based on the assumption that there is a correlation between heat flow and geology. This assumption is assessed and the correlation is found to provide a minor improvement over assuming that heat flow would be represented by the global average. The map is made available digitally.

HISPID3 - Herbarium Information Standards and Protocols for Interchange of Data,,http://www.tdwg.org/standards/110/,"The 'Herbarium Information Standards and Protocols for Interchange of Data' (HISPID) is a standard format for the interchange of electronic herbarium specimen information. HISPID has been developed by a committee of representatives from all major Australian herbaria. This interchange standard was first published in 1989, with a revised version published in 1993.HISPID3 is an accession-based interchange standard. Although many fields refer to attributes of the taxon they should be construed as applying to the specimen represented by the record, not to the taxon per se. The interchange of taxonomic, nomenclatural, bibliographic, typification, rare and endangered plant conservation, and other related information is not dealt with in this standard, unless it specifically refers to a particular accession (record).This data dictionary is concerned primarily with data interchange standards but has considerable relevance to database structure since the task of preparing interchange files is simplified if the data fields of the despatching and receiving databases match, as far as possible, the interchange standard. If differences do exist then, generally, it is easier to combine data fields than it is to dissect them in a reliable manner. Fields that are concatenated are frequently heterogeneous in their nature and many preclude the possibility of rearranging the data contained within such fields.The fields discussed in this data dictionary cover most of the herbarium and botanic gardens sphere of activity and have been arranged in groups of similar types of information. In many cases these groups may coincide with separate well defined tables (or databases) of structurally similar records.The challenge for herbarium data managers is to decide whether the data are to be efficiently exchanged as discrete but related tables (databases) or as a larger single flat file that may have to be appropriately dismembered by the receiving institution. Some database packages are able to stack multiple values in a single field. This useful data structure complicates the interchange format and will not be used at this stage.",hli,specification,TDWG,Conceptual,Biology,Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG),,,,,,,,,,HISPID3 - Herbarium Information Standards and Protocols for Interchange of Data,globe.jpg,specification

The objective is to achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms shaping and influencing landscape, environment and human impact of this eco-region. Thus, its aim is to anticipate the behaviour of this system over a century, from an interdisciplinary analysis conducted over the 2010-2020 decade. The ultimate goal of this program is to predict the evolution of habitable conditions in this large ecosystem, to meet the public policies concerning resources and environment, to anticipate evolution of the societies and to propose policies and adaptative measures that would optimize them.",,database,,AdHoc,Geology,Mediterranean Integrated STudies at Regional And Local Scales,,,,,,,,,,MISTRALS Database,database.jpg,database

The E1-M3A site (Cretan Sea) and Pylos site (Southern Ionian Sea) are deployed in an area with complex hydrology where intermediate and dense water formation takes place (CIW, CDW) while water masses formed in the Levantine and the northern Aegean Sea meet and interact with those locally produced. The platform which has been upgraded recently through POSEIDON II project hosts a variety of different sensors measuring meteorological, physical and biochemical parameters. The buoy used at these sites is a Seawatch-Wavescan type which is a multi-parametric instrumentation platform and suitable for deployment in deep offshore locations (Furgo OCEANOR www.oceanor.no). The two stations are programmed to collect the data every three (3) hours and upon collection to transmit them to the receiving station.  The sea-bed observatory lies on the sea bottom and it has built-in sensors capable of recording at a high resolution the water column pressure, temperature and salinity. The communication between the platform and the surface buoy is achieved through hydro-acoustic modems. The coupling of a sea bottom observing platform with a multi-parametric mooring, creates new opportunities of monitoring the ocean not only through air-sea interaction related parameters or the first few hundred meters of the water column data, but also through geo-physical and bio-chemical data of the deep sea basin that are now becoming available.",,platform,,Not Evaluated,Ocean Science,National Oceanography Centre,,,,,,,,,,Pylos Observatory,globe.jpg,platform

SPADE 2 aims to provide sufficient soil property data to support higher tier modeling of pesticide fate at the European level. Data supplied by each country were based on the national data archives and, for some parameters, particularly particle-size distribution, the analytical techniques used varied slightly from country to country. The raw data supplied by national data providers has thus been harmonised and validated to provide a single data file (SPADE_2.dbf) that can be easily used in conjunction with the SGDBE. Harmonisation of particle-size data was carried out using a monotonic cubic spline interpolation procedure. Validation analyses have been carried out to ensure that any problems related to the harmonisation procedure were identified and corrected and that the range and population distributions of all parameters were consistent with expected patterns and ranges. Unusual outliers within parameter data sets were identified and, if necessary, corrected. As a result of the limitations of the SPADE-1 profile data for use in modelling at the European level, the European Crop Protection Association (ECPA), supported by the European Soil Bureau of the European Commission Joint Research Centre have sponsored the collation of a second profile database (SPADE-2) for use with the SGDBE. The overall objective was to provide sufficient soil property data to support higher tier modelling of pesticide fate at the European level.",,database,,Community-Established,Soil Science,European Soil Bureau (ESBN),,,,,,,,,,SPADE-2 - Soil Profile Analytical Database,database.jpg,database
SPADE/M - Soil Profile Analytical Database of Europe of Measured parameters,,http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/spade/spadeM.html,The Soil Profile Analytical Database of Europe of Measured parameters (SPADE/M) is part of the distribution package of the Soil Geographic Database of Eurasia (SGDBE). It was created to provide a common structure for storing standardized information on typical soil profile properties of major European soils. The criterion applied to include a profile in the database was to adequately cover the range of European soils rather than to sample profiles for a statistical representation of soil properties at European scale. The typical combinations of profile parameters and morphological characteristics of the sample site were intended to support the definition of generalized rules for estimating pedological and hydrological properties of the pedo-transfer rule (PTR) database of the SGDBE. Compared to the spatial database the information on measured profiles has received relatively little attention,,database,,Community-Established,Soil Science,European Soil Bureau (ESBN),,,,,,,,,,SPADE/M - Soil Profile Analytical Database of Europe of Measured parameters,database.jpg,database

Spatial Information System (SIS),,http://sis.apache.org/,"Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a free software, Java language library for developing geospatial applications. SIS enables better representation of coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or any other relevant spatial needs. The library is an implementation of GeoAPI 3.0 interfaces and can be used for desktop or server applications.
SIS provides data structures for geographic data and associated metadata along with methods to manipulate those data structures. The SIS metadata module forms the base of the library and enables the creation of metadata objects which comply with the ISO 19115 metadata model and which can be read from or written to ISO 19139 compliant XML documents. The SIS referencing module will enable the construction of geodetic data structures for geospatial referencing based on the ISO 19111 model such as axis, projection and coordinate reference system definitions, along with the associated operations which enable the mathematical conversion of coordinates between different systems of reference. The SIS storage modules will provide a common approach to the reading and writing of grid coverages applicable to simple imagery as to many dimensional data structures

Structured Descriptive Data,,http://www.tdwg.org/standards/116/,"In taxonomy, descriptive data takes a number of very different forms. Natural-language descriptions are semi-structured, semi-formalised descriptions of a taxon (or occasionally of an individual specimen). They may be simple, short and written in plain language (if used for a popular field guide), or long, highly formal and using specialised terminology when used in a taxonomic monograph or other treatment. Dichotomous keys are specialised identification tools comprising fragments of descriptive data arranged in couplets forming a branching tree. Each fragment (lead) comprises a small (occasionally verbose) natural-language description. Raw data descriptions usually comprise repeated measurements of parts of individual specimens, and are the basis from which the more abstracted descriptions in natural language and coded descriptions are derived. Few taxonomists consistently record and archive their raw data in a standardised format. The goal of the SDD standard is to allow capture, transport, caching and archiving of descriptive data in all the forms shown above, using a platform- and application-independent, international standard. Such a standard is crucial to enabling lossless porting of data between existing and future software platforms including identification, data-mining and analysis tools, and federated databases.",hli,specification,TDWG,Conceptual,Biology,Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG),,,,,,,,,,Structured Descriptive Data,globe.jpg,specification

Taxonomic Concept Transfer Schema,,http://www.tdwg.org/standards/117/,"The TCS schema was conceived to allow the representation of taxonomic concepts as defined in published taxonomic classifications, revisions and databases. As such, it specifies the structure for XML documents to be used for the transfer of defined concepts. Valid transfer documents may either explicitly detail the defining components of taxon concepts, transfer GUIDs referring to defined taxon concepts (if and when these are available) or a mixture of the two. The TCS schema is not designed to facilitate the exchange or documentation of information about Taxon Concepts where this information is not part of a taxonomic revision creating new concepts. The amount and variety of (additional) information that can be potentially assigned to concepts is outside the scope of a taxonomic concept transfer schema, but we would encourage the development of domain specfic models that use or extend this schema. XML supports this flexibility by allowing the use of different name spaces.For example, whilst a TCS taxon concept definition may include details of specimen circumscription (i.e. list specimens that are asserted to define the taxon concept) datasets that merely include observations identifying specimens as being examples of a taxon concept would reference a defined taxon concept, not constitute a new or modified concept.

World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions,,http://www.tdwg.org/standards/109/,"In setting out to establish standards for data fields in botanical databases, the International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases for Plant Sciences (TDWG) identified at an early stage of its existence a need for an agreed system of geographical units at approximately ""country"" level and upwards for use in recording plant distributions. This would aim to provide a standard which different organisations maintaining databases could adopt so that they could compare and exchange data with each other without loss of information due to incompatible geographical boundaries. The present publication has resulted from the deliberations over a period of three years of a committee of both taxonomic and applied botanists set up to produce such a standard.
The system offered covers the whole world and identifies units at four levels, firstly continental, secondly regional (or subcontinental), thirdly at what may be called ""Botanical Country"" level (which may often ignore purely political considerations), and fourthly at a slightly lower level called ""Basic Recording Units"" where political integrity is fully recognised. In many cases, where Botanical Countries have no complicating political factors, the units at Level-3 and Level-4 are identical. Very large countries, however, have been subdivided into more conveniently sized units according to constituent states or provinces. It is a fundamental principle that units at all levels are bounded either by political boundaries which appear on modern maps or by coast lines. Modern geographical information systems have not superseded the need for such a scheme.
This publication provides an introduction to the system followed by an account of the rationale behind decisions and the problems that had to be considered in its design. The geographical standard itself is presented in five tables. A gazetteer is included which relates over 2100 geographical names to this system. Finally, the units recognised are shown in seventeen maps.",hli,vocabulary,information exchange,Conceptual,Biology,Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG),,,,,,,,,,World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions,vocabulary.jpg,vocabulary
