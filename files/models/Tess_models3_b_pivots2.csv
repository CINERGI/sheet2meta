165,2D Ground Water Salt-Heat Transport with Freezing,2D_V_HYDRO_S,V.I.Sabinin,mailto:sabinin@hydro.nsc.ru,"The 2D-V-HYDRO-S program can model transient or steady-state two-dimensional profile flows of ground water with contaminant transport and heat transport added with account of freezing. One can turn off the heat or/and salt transport if it is necessary.  The region of the modelling is bounded by earth surface, impermeable bottom, river bank slopes, and vertical lines of simmetry. Drains, vertical impermeable screens, and freezing columns can be inside of the region. Infiltration of fresh or salt water or evaporation can be from the earth too. The ground is supposed be lithologically layered.  The modelling is based on: 1) a hydrodynamical model of groundwater filtration with incomplete pore saturation, 2) an equation of convective dispersion for contaminant transport, 3) an equation of heat transport and heat conductivity with account of freezing, 4) soil/water and salt/heat relations.  The model is implemented with the help of finite-difference approximations on non- uniform grids and new iterative techniques of the incomplete factorization method. There is a version of the program which takes into account a cation exchange of Na, Ca, and Mg.  Output results computed at given times are grid values and isolines of head, water content, concentration, and temperature, as far as integrated parameters of the flows, boundaries of saturated zones and frozen zones of the region. Pictures of the isolines can be saved in PCX-files.  The program takes input data from a text file which can be created by a special utility. The utility uses a mouse to set all parameters of the problem in visual interactive mode.  The program can be used to calculate ground water flows through a damb, to systematical or another horizontal drainage, under heavy buildings, from surface or inner sources of pollution, between frozen or another screens, to river banks, from channals, and in combinations of these conditions. It calculates salt and heat transport by these flows, too.",,Non_GIS,,"Agriculture & apiculture (examples: arable farming, animal husbandry, horticulture, olive production, pollination, biofuels)",,,"Geometrical parameters of a flow region and of artificial objects inside.

Westover",,"The Sorghum Pest Management Report Database System was developed to provide growers, scouts and county agents with a computerized method of entering, storing and summarizing pest management data collected in sorghum fields. This system has computerized entry forms, the ability to edit the data, facilities to search for particular records in the database, report generation and simple character-level graphics. Several report formats are available, along with the ability to create external ASCII files. Data is entered into the Sorghum Pest Management Report system via blocked entry forms displayed on four screens. Records can be modified by selecting the edit option from the Add/Edit menu. The following is the information stored in the database: field identification number, name of grower or operator, name of county, name of scout(s), date of survey report, time of survey, sorghum growth stage, average number green bug/plant, green bug damage rating, corn leaf aphid damage rating, average number of sorghum midge/head, average number of adult lady beetles/plant, average number of larval lady beetles/plant, average number of parasite mummies/plant, percent green bugs parasitized, rating of other benefits, and any desired comment. The only requirement needed to generate a report is selection of the output variables. Any variable in the database can be selected to generate preset reports. Reports can be based on certain search parameter, e.g. a report for fields in a particular county or a report for sorghum stage between 2 through 10 and green bug population between July 1 and July 31. If numeric variables are chosen, the average for each variable is printed at the end of the report. The reports can be in a tabular format, bar chart or scatter plot. Tabular reports can be sent to the printer, a disk file or the screen. Character level graphs are available, but are normally displayed on the screen. Printed graphs are available using the print screen option of the host computer. Program Limitations The program does not check all input data ranges for appropriate values and there is no check for duplicate records. Only 2 variables are allowed in the bar charts and scatter plots. Variable headings and report output may not always line up correctly. No specific search capabilities are available for all combinations of variables and value ranges. However, since this application was written in dBASE II, functions or options not available in this program can be done \'manually\' at the dBASE prompt by typing the proper command.

The model uses weather data and local cropping information to make population predictions. The predictions can be used for strategic planning of planting dates and for within season predictions of control dates.   Input to run the model consists of estimates of the following information: planting date; field acreage; sorghum variety name; latitude; first planting date for sorghum in the local area; last planting date for sorghum in the local area; expected severity rating; Johnsongrass infestation rating; percent of total acres of sorghum in the local area; and estimated percent of sorghum acres in five planting date classes.   This model calculates the density of two developmental stages, eggs and adults, of the sorghum midge. Midge adults are assumed to come from three sources: 1) spring emergence from diapause, 2) individuals that use Johnsongrass as a host, and 3) individuals that use grain sorghum as a host.   Several simplifying assumptions about the environment are made. Most important is the treatment of a growing region as homogeneous. That is, midge populations respond to the availability of sorghum plants as hosts within the entire region rather than within localized fields of sorghum plants.   This model has been developed based on research of the biology of the sorghum midge. However, the model as a whole has not had extensive field evaluations in all areas where sorghum midge occurs.   The program interfaces with the Weather Data Editor (ACJ) for editing and storage of historical and current weather data.",,,,"Physical hazards (examples: fires, floods, air quality, water quality, carbon storage)",,,,http://ecobas.org/www-server/index.html,,Simulative prediction,,,"Ecosystem (examples: food chains, natural communities, biotopes)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,

The acronym ACRU is derived from the Agricultural Catchments Research Unit within the Department of Agricultural Engineering of the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg. The agrohydrological component of ACRU first came to the fore during research on an agrohydrological and agroclimatological atlas for Natal (Schulze, 1983). Since then the model has developed, through co-operation with many colleagues and graduate students, and through generous funding from the Water Research Commission (WRC), to its present status.    User documentation on ACRU was first published in 1984 (Schulze, 1984) and updated in 1989 (Schulze, George, Lynch and Angus, 1989). A series of papers and reports applying constantly updated and more sophisticated versions of the model has been published in the international and southern African literature, the major papers on developmental aspects being an overview by Schulze (1986), a paper on its application as a dynamic simulator of afforestation effects on runoff (Schulze and George, 1987a), a synthesis on its status as of 1988 by Schulze (1988a) and an unpublished report to the WRC in 1992 on new development to the model up to then, mainly in regard to flow routing, wetlands, shallow groundwater routines, a forest Decision Support System and model linkage to GIS. This present text, viz. \""Hydrology and Agrohydrology: A Text to Accompany the ACRU 3.00 Modelling System\"", supersedes and replaces the 1989 \""ACRU: Background, Concepts and Theory\"" (Schulze, 1989a).   The companion volume to this present text is the \""ACRU 3.00 User Manual\"" under editorship of Smithers and Schulze (1994), which in turn supersedes the \""ACRU-2 : User Manual\"" by Schulze, George, Lynch and Angus (1989).    Other than in southern Africa (South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho, Swaziland and Zimbabwe), lectures on the ACRU system have been given in Australia, Austria, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Kenya, Portugal, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. The model has been verified widely on data from southern Africa and the USA (Schulze, 1994, Chapter 22), used extensively in decision making in southern Africa and by 1994 the model had been applied internationally in research in Botswana, Chile, Germany, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland and the USA.",Universal,,"Rule-based (e.g. qualitative reasoning, rules, rates, enviromental ontologies)","Agriculture & apiculture (examples: arable farming, animal husbandry, horticulture, olive production, pollination, biofuels), Foresty (examples: coppicing, paper, timber, charcoal, cork)",,FORTRAN,"Daily rainfall, daily or monthly evaporation, soils and land use parameters",http://ecobas.org/www-server/index.html,"Microsoft (Windows, Silverlight, .net etc), Unix, Linux, or other Unix-like",Optimization process,,Research (descriptive),"Water, catchment (examples: hydrological, water pollution) , Soil and rock (examples: erosion, fertility, compaction), Vegetation including fungi (examples: genetics, species, populations, guilds, habitats)",,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,
278,RICE WATER WEEVIL MODEL,ACZ_TX,"Dr. John A. Jackman, Dr. B. M. Drees",,"Keywords: pest, Rice Water Weevil, crop, rice,empirical equation, temperature sum based, degree day event predictor   This program predicts the emergence of Rice Water Weevil adults from their overwintering habitats which include bunch grasses in wayside areas. After the accumulation of sufficient heat units, adults leave these sites and search for other suitable host plants which includes rice. If rice is in a susceptible stage of vegetative growth and has been flooded or remains in a flood-like condition from persistent rains, weevils will land in fields, produce feeding scars on leaves and deposit eggs. Predictions generated from this program help schedule field scouting activities to determine if an application of an insecticide is justified.   Basically the program requires two types of input: the weather data and the viewing dates. There are two types of weather data: the current weather file and the historical weather file. The quality of the prediction depends on the usage of current weather file, so it is advisable that you always use the current weather file. The program will use the historical weather data for a date only if the current weather data for that date is blank in the current weather data file.  Viewing dates are a set of dates for which rice water weevil emergence will be reported by the program. The viewing dates are selected by specifying a starting date and an ending date. The program will always run the model starting from April 21 until the cumulative emergence reaches 100% regardless of what dates you choose as the starting and ending dates. The dates only affect the report and not the prediction itself.   Additional supporting data needed by the program is the current date, the county name, and the type of graph to be displayed. The current date and the county name is needed for reporting purposes only. The type of graph affects which information is displayed in the graphic reports.   The program can produce two types of output: a numerical report and a graphic report. The numerical report is the more accurate and comprehensive since the graphic report has low resolution. The numerical report includes both the daily and cumulative emergence predicted. The user can choose what data to be displayed in the graphic report (daily emergence only, cumulative emergence only, or both at the same time).

This information may be generated within AMORPHYS, supplied from a file, or entered in AMORPHYS\'s spreadsheet. Unentered key dimensions of the model trees, other than diameter, are automatically estimated. Diameter ordinarily is measured at a height of 0.1 m on a short tree or at 1.37 m if the base of the live crown has risen to that height or greater.     The growth and development of model trees are projected on an annual basis. The morphological dimensions of each model tree are constrained to accord with pipe-model theory. Annual changes in the dimensions (and components of dry matter) of each model tree are estimated with submodels that track carbon assimilation and allocation, crown-rise, and senescence. Responses by a model tree to irrigation, climate, and the increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide are effected through the assimilation and allocation submodel. Responses to crowding (and thinning and pruning) are effected mechanistically through the crown-rise submodel. Three-dimensional snapshots of the development of the stand at different points in time are rendered through a \""stand visualization system.\""     AMORPHYS estimates a large suite of variables of interest to foresters and ecologists, the latter including net primary productivity and annual production of litter and coarse woody debris.

It comprises a set of simulation models of all basic regional ecosystem components (soil cover, vegetation, ground water deposits and quality, relief characteristics, atmospheric circulation, pollutants accumulation and migration). It is a complex finite state model; the dynamics of an agroecological system are being represented as transition between pre-defined functional states. Each component of an agroecosystem is identified by a polynomial aggregated index, characterizing it?s participation in the whole system?s functioning. The dynamics of a system are estimated using a recursive discrete algorithm:   1. determination of aggregated indexes   2. recognition of system state   3. appraisal of external influence   4. assessment of system state change   subsequent recognition of system state (step 2). The simulation step is one year. Using aggregated indexes instead of direct values greatly improves the model performance and significantly simplifies forecasting process. The AREFS model was certified and recommended by the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of the Russian Federation. It was successfully used for estimation of consequences caused by Chernobyl nuclear incident (1990); development of Land Use Program for Central Chernozem region of Russia (1995) and in a number of international projects (IGBP program for global climate warming assessment and others).

173,Bioaccumulation and Aquatic System Simulator,BASS,,,"Craig Barber is the principal developer of the Bioaccumulation and Aquatic System Simulator (BASS) which is a Fortran 95 simulation model that predicts the population and bioaccumulation dynamics of age-structured fish assemblages which are exposed to hydrophobic organic pollutants and class B and borderline metals that complex with sulfhydryl groups (e.g., cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc). BASS's bioaccumulation algorithms are based on diffusion kinetics and are coupled to a process-based model for the growth of individual fish. The model's exchange algorithms consider both biological attributes of fishes and physico-chemical properties of the chemicals of concern that determine diffusive exchange across gill membranes and intestinal mucosa. Biological characteristics used by the model include the fish's gill morphometry, feeding and growth rate, and proximate composition (i.e., its fractional aqueous, lipid, and structural organic content). Relevant physico-chemical properties are the chemical's aqueous diffusivity, n-octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow), and, for metals, binding coefficients to proteins and other organic matter. bass simulates the growth of individual fish using a standard mass balance, bioenergetic model (i.e., growth = ingestion - egestion - respiration - specific dynamic action - excretion). A fish's realized ingestion is calculated from its maximum consumption rate adjusted for the availability of prey of the appropriate size and taxonomy. The community's food web is specified by defining one or more foraging classes for each fish species based on either its body weight, body length, or age. The dietary composition of each of these feeding classes is specified as a combination of benthos, incidental terrestrial insects, periphyton/attached algae, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and one or more fish species. Population dynamics are generated by predatory mortalities defined by community's food web and standing stocks, size dependent physiological mortality rates, the maximum longevity of species, and toxicological responses to chemical exposures. The model's temporal and spatial scales of resolution are a day and a hectare, respectively. Currently, BASS ignores the migration of fish into and out of the simulated hectare.  BASS is currently being used to investigate methylmercury bioaccumulation in the Florida Everglades and to predict population and community dimensions of ""fish health"" for a regional analysis of the ecological sustainability of the Albemarle-Pamlico drainage basin in North Caorolina and Virginia.",,,,"Aquaculture & commercial fishing (examples: salmon farming, ostreiculture)",,,,http://www.epa.gov/athens/staff/members/barbermahlonc/index.html,,,,,"Water, catchment (examples: hydrological, water pollution)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,

298,BigUrchin Metapopulation Model,BigUrchin,D. R. Lockwood,mailto:mailto:drlockwood@ucdavis.edu,"Keywords: larval dispersal, invertebrate populations, urchins,crabs, rock fish   BigUrchin is a population model. This model was developed to allow accurate examination of the effects of spatial management of an invertebrate fishery, in addition to the effects of conventional management by size limit and fishing effort. It consists of 24 size structured subpopulations, linked by larval dispersal. The size structure is described by von Bertalanffy growth with variation in L? among individuals. Larval dispersal is described by a dispersal matrix. Post-dispersal density-dependence is a Beverton-Holt relationship.   The program was originally designed to model the population of the red sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) along the northern California coast. It has been modified to be more generic. While being more generic, the model still has implicit assumptions about the life cycle of the organism that should be considered before using it to model other species.   The model assumes that the population disperses only during the larval phase and adult movement is within each subpopulation\'s range only. The population has synchronous spawning and a coherent settlement cycle. The current version has explicit assumptions about the size of the organisms but this can be adjusted by scaling the inputs. The growth, mortality and settlement functions are fixed, though parameter values may be varied as described in the Model section.   The model currently has default values corresponding to the northern California red sea urchin fishery. Parameter values of the size structured subpopulation models were estimated from size distribution and growth increment data. The 24 locations correspond to deep and shallow areas in each of the 12 CDF&G sectors which are 10\' of latitude. These are likely management areas.   The model can be run in either a batch mode or an interactive mode through a graphical interface.

It solves the boundary value problem within intersecting fracture planes using the boundary integral method applied to two- (BIM2D) and three-dimensional (BIM3D) formulations for flow using a constant capillary head within individual fractures. The transport problem is solved through calculating travel times and breakthrough curves by integrating the inverse velocity over a streamline, and then summing over all streamlines. The transport equation includes linear equilibrium reversible sorption (retardation) and diffusion from fractures into the rock matrix and v.v. FRACGEN generates synthetic fracture networks for sensitivity analysis with respect to fracture network parameters. The program BIM provides estimates of steady flow rates, hydraulic head distributions, travel times and breakthrough curves for discrete fracture networks, incorporating both saturated and variably saturated flow. The program BIM2D is used to dicretize the fracture network and then solve for steady fluid flow and transport using the boundary integral method. It is limited to applications involving non-porous rock. The program BIM3D is used to study coupled flow through a fracture network embedded within a permeable matrix.

To do this, the basic BIOCLIM algorithm (Nix 1986, Busby 1991, McMahon et al. 1996) finds the climatic range of the points for each climatic variable. The Climatic Envelope Model is a GARP-simulation of the bounding box, climate envelope method as used in BIOCLIM. It uses the concept of a bounding box to enclose the data points formed from a number of climate variables derived from climate surfaces (see below). It differs from the BIOCLIM program in the rule-based algorithm it uses to derive the predictions.The rules used here, consisting of ranges of climate for all climate variables, then encloses all points, within statistically defined limits.

Colin Prentice,mailto:colin.prentice@bgc-jena.mpg.de,"Keywords: carbon dynamics, global change, plant functional type, NPP  BIOME3, which employs a more explicitly mechanistic scheme for vegetation physiology and has been more thoroughly tested for the global scale has superseded BIOME2 that is described as part of the VEMAP project on this page.  BIOME3 is an equilibrium terrestrial biosphere model that has been implemented globally using a minimal set of just five woody and two grass plant types. In BIOME3, leaf area is expressed as leaf area index (LAI). A small number of ecophysiological constraints is used to select the plant types that may be present in a particular climate. The model then calculates a maximum sustainable LAI and NPP for each plant type.  Gross primary production (GPP) is calculated as a linear function of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation based on a optimized version of the Farquhar photosynthesis equation (Haxeltine and Prentice 1996a). GPP is reduced by drought stress and low temperatures. Respiration is calculated with a semi-mechanistic model which partitions whole plant respiration costs into leaf respiration, transport tissue respiration, fine root respiration and growth respiration.   A semi-empirical rule designed to capture the opposing effects of succession driven by light competition and natural distrubance by fire excludes grasses as a dominant plant type if soil conditions are too wet. Otherwise, the plant type with the highest NPP is selected as the dominant plant type.  Model output consists of a quantitative vegetation state description in terms of the dominant plant type, secondary plant types present and the total LAI and NPP for the ecosystem. As in BIOME2, this basic model output is classified into biomes for comparison with vegetation maps.  The photosynthesis and water balance schemes are mechanistically coupled through stomatal conductance, thus allowing the model to simulate the response of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and leaf area to environmental factors including atmospheric CO2. Laboratory studies show that stomatal conductance decreases in response to increasing CO2 concentration. However, regional decreases in stomatal conductance would result in a regional-scale feedback on evapotranspriation, leading to a smaller decrease in transpiration than that obtained at the leaf level. To incorporate this potentially important feedback, transpiration is calculated in BIOME3 using a simple, but well-tested, equation to describe the process of \\\""accomodation\\\"" between transpiring plant surfaces and the water vapour content of the planetary boundary layer (Monteith, 1995).",,,"Rule-based (e.g. qualitative reasoning, rules, rates, enviromental ontologies)","Physical hazards (examples: fires, floods, air quality, water quality, carbon storage), Biodiversity conservation (examples: protection, reserves, re-introduction, alien species)",,FORTRAN 77,,http://ecobas.org/www-server/index.html,,Simulative prediction,Single computer/PDA,,"Vegetation including fungi (examples: genetics, species, populations, guilds, habitats)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,

The code also simulates reaeration and anaerobic biodegradation as a first order decay in hydrocarbon concentrations. The model is based on the 1987 version of the USGS two-dimensional method of characteristics transport model by Konikow and Bredehoeft. It computes the changes in concentration over time due to convection, dispersion, mixing, and biodegradation. BIOPLUME II solves the transport equation twice: once for hydrocarbon and once for oxygen. As a result, two plumes are computed at every time step. The model assumes instantaneous reaction between oxygen and hydrocarbon to simulate biodegradation processes. The two plumes are combined using the principle of superposition. The model allows injection wells to be specified as oxygen sources into a contaminated aquifer. It provides three additional sources of oxygen: 1) initial dissolved oxygen in the uncontaminated aquifer; 2) natural recharge of oxygen across the boundaries; and 3) vertical exchange of oxygen from the unsaturated zone (reaeration). The model comes with a menu-driven, interactive preprocessor and handles a 20 x 30 cell grid. The software includes a post processor which can convert output data to a format usable by commercial contouring packages.

309,BIOTEST,BIOTEST,Camillo Dejak,mailto:pastres@unive.it,"Keywords: water quality, pollution, nutrient concentration, biomass   This finite- difference model considers a small three dimensional grid (min 4 x 4 x 2 cells) where macronutrients and heat are introduced at constant rate in the upper corner cell and dispersed by means of a turbulent diffusive process. Eight state variables are followed: Phyto- and zooplankton densities, reduced and oxidized nitrogen concentrations, reactive phosphorus concentration, dissolved organic detritus, dissolved oxygen and sedimented organic detritus. The forcing fuctions are the input rates, the water temerature and the sunlight intensity. The last two can be calculated as indicated in the 1-D vertical model proposed by the same authors, or introduced by the user. The system can reach a steady state condition if the forcing functions are kept constant because the two horizontal walls opposite the input corner are open to the outward fluxes. A smooth behaviour of the numerical solution of the reaction diffusion equation which connect the state variables is assured by purposely studied boundary conditions. According with this approach, external values are extrapolated by assuming that the three last grid point follow a gaussian profile, whose asymptotic behaviour can be set by the user or computed using the 1-D model. The model can represent with sufficient approximation a small lake or pond not completely mixed or a shallow water basin strongly influenced by the tide, where the advection does not, on average, contribute significantly to the dispersion process. It can also been used as a quick tool for testing some improvements for an already existing combined transport-water quality model, as the computational request of the program can be conveniently satisfied by a 486 PC.   Model purpose  The simulation of the yearly dynamic of a two trophic level aquatic ecosystem under continuous flow of nutrients, dispersed by turbulent diffusion through the open boundaries, is achieved by using a very samll grid size.

314,"BROOK, BROOK2 and BROOK90",BROOK,: C. Anthony Federer,mailto:tony@ecoshift.net,"Keywords: snow, soil water, precipitation, richards equation, temperature, cutting effects, evapotranspiration, stream flow   : Brook is a hydrological model that simulates snow accumulation, soil water and streamflow from daily precipitation and temperature. The original version of this model was developed in the late 1970s (Federer and Lash, 1978). BROOK2 is a newer version used extensively for teaching and research of snow-soil-streamflow dynamics.   Brook is a deterministic model that looks at hydrologic dynamics at the watershed level. The model contains several water storage compartments: snow, root zone, unsaturated zone below the root zone and groundwater. Input of the model is daily mean temperatures and precipitation. Snowmelt by degree-day factor is adjusted for by leaf area index (LAI) and stem area index (SAI).   BROOK90 contains major modifications to the state equations in the model. For example, potential transpiration and soil evaporation are calculated using the Shuttleworth-Wallace equations and vertical water movement is calculated using a modified Clapp-Hornberger relation. Input required for BROOK90 differs slightly form the earlier versions. Weather information for example must include daily maximum and minimum temperatures, and wind speed. Several additional parameters are needed, including: soils water properties, and stomatal response parameters.   BROOK90 simulates the land phase of the precipitation evaporation streamflow part of the hydrologic cycle for a point or for a small, uniform (lumped parameter) watershed. There is no provision for spatial distribution of parameters in the horizontal. There is no provision for lateral transfer of water to adjacent downslope areas. Instead, BROOK90 concentrates on detailed simulation of evaporation processes, on vertical water flow, and of local generation of stormflow. Below ground, the model includes one to many soil layers, which may have differing physical properties.   BROOK90 has been designed to be applicable to any land surface. The model has numerous parameters, but all parameters are provided externally, are physically meaningful, and have default values. Parameter fitting is not necessary to obtain reasonable results. However, a procedure is described for modifying important parameters to improve the fit of simulated to measured streamflow.   BROOK90 is designed to fill a wide range of needs: as a research tool to study the water budget and water movement on small plots, as a teaching tool for evaporation and soil water processes, as a water budget model for land managers and for predicting climate change effects, and as a fairly complex water budget model against which simpler models can be tested.   Evaporation has five components: evaporation of intercepted rain (IRVP), evaporation of intercepted snow (ISVP), evaporation from snow (SNVP), soil evaporation (SLVP) from the top soil layer, and transpiration (TRANI) from each soil layer that contains roots. Potential evaporation rates are obtained using the Shuttleworth and Wallace (1985) modification of the Penman-Monteith approach. Evaporation of intercepted rain or snow is calculated with a canopy resistance of zero and aerodynamic resistances based on canopy height, coupled with a canopy capacity and an average storm duration. For potential transpiration, canopy resistance depends on maximum leaf conductance, reduced for humidity, temperature, and light penetration. Aerodynamic resistances are modified from Shuttleworth and Gurney (1990); they depend on leaf area index (LAI), which can vary seasonally, and on canopy height, which determines stem area index (SAI). Soil evaporation resistance depends on soil water potential in the top soil layer. Actual transpiration is the lesser of potential transpiration and a soil water supply rate determined by the resistance to liquid water flow in the plants and on root distribution and soil water potential in the soil layers.   Snowmelt is based on a degree day factor and accounts for snowpack temperature and liquid water content. The factor is modified for canopy cover as determined by LAI and SAI. Snow evaporation or condensation depends on the aerodynamic resistances and the vapor gradient; however, an arbitrary reduction factor is required.   Net throughfall plus snowmelt may 1) infiltrate into the soil matrix of the surface horizon (INFLI(1)), 2) infiltrate directly to deeper horizons via vertical macropore flow (INFLI), 3) go immediately to streamflow via vertical macropore flow followed by downslope pipe flow (BYFLI), or 4) go immediately to streamflow via impaction on a variable saturated source area (SRFL). Water in the soil matrix (SWATI) moves vertically according to the Darcy Richards equation for saturated or unsaturated flow. A downslope flow component may also be simulated (DSFLI). Integration of these rates is by explicit forward difference (Euler), but with a variable iteration time step that limits changes in layer water content and in potential gradients. The relationships among matric potential, soil water content, and hydraulic conductivity are parameterized by a modified Clapp-Hornberger formulation with values given at field capacity. Water is added to groundwater by gravity drainage from the deepest soil layer. The groundwater component of streamflow (GWFL) is simulated as a fixed fraction of groundwater each day. A fixed fraction of the groundwater outflow may be deep seepage. Simulated streamflow is the sum of SRFL, BYFL, DSFL, and GWFL. This can be compared with measured streamflow if that is available.",,Non_GIS,,"Physical hazards (examples: fires, floods, air quality, water quality, carbon storage)",,FORTRAN,"• daily precipitation,   • daily minimum temperature and   • maximum temperature as input;   optional inputs are:   • solar radiation,   • humidity,   • wind speed, and   • intra-daily precipitation",http://ecobas.org/www-server/index.html,"Microsoft (Windows, Silverlight, .net etc)",Simulative prediction,Single computer/PDA,,"Water, catchment (examples: hydrological, water pollution)",Not specified,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,
315,Barataria-Terrebonne Ecosystem Landscape Spatial Simulation,BTELSS,,,"Keywords: Barataria Basin (Louisiana, USA), deltaic habitats, response to multiple impacts, spatial modeling, Terrebonne Basin (Louisiana, USA), watersheds   A landscape model was developed to investigate and predict the environmental factors affecting wetland habitat change within the Barataria and Terrebonne basins of coastal Louisiana for a 30-year time scale. The model linked an overland flooding hydrodynamic module, using cells of 100 km2 in size and operating at a 1 hour time-step, and a spatially articulated ecosystem module, resolving habitat type and change for 1 km2 cells in daily time steps. Integration across different temporal and spatial scales was accomplished with interpolation routines and averaging algorithms. Forcing functions included dominant regional processes, such as subsidence, sedimentation and sea-level rise. Hydrologic functions were calibrated against existing climate and hydrologic time-series, while habitat information was compared to maps prepared by the United States Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) for 1978 and 1988.  Spatial calibration was done by initializing the landscape pattern of the model to a 1978 USFWS habitat map. After a 10-year simulation, the results were compared against a 1988 USFWS habitat map. Simulated maps had an accuracy of 85 to 90 (out of a maximum of 100), based on a multiple resolution fit algorithm. For validation, the model was initialized with a 1956 USFWS habitat map and the results from a 32-year simulation were compared to the 1988 USFWS habitat map. The landscape model produced reasonable regional agreement, despite the fact that small-scale processes and features were not included. The validation runs produced land loss rates that matched historical trends with an accuracy fit above 75.  The model simulated 30 years into the future, starting in 1988, testing for long-term climate variability under diverse scenarios. Results indicated that weather variability impacts land loss rates more than replication of extreme weather years. Even when extreme dry and wet years were repeated, the model predicted lower land loss when compared to historical records. This is indicative of the ability of the simulated plant communities to adapt to repetitive climatic forcing functions.

The objective was to develop a water balance submodel which can be run with readily available inputs. The model predicts water use, soil evaporation, crop transpiration throughout the growing season. Physiological reduction factors, as influenced by water stress, are derived from the soil water availability. This was achieved by using empirical relationships such as the reservoir analogy to assess water availability in relation to root development. The framework of using conditions is assessed by sensitivity analyses performed on inputs: the model can be run with an incrementing time step of ten days and soil information given by soil maps, i.e. soil texture and depth, which fits to agrometeorological purposes.

We developed an ecological model that integrates present environmental conditions, mimics several event pulsing scenarios, such as different river diversion deliveries and hurricane-related tidal intrusions, and evaluates watershed health through long-term scenarios. This model consisted of a grid of spatially articulated unit models (14,806 active cells) that interact hydrological and ecologically. For calibration purposes, the spatial model was initialized under 1978 environmental conditions and run for 10 years. The calibration exercise was determined satisfactory, once the comparative fit index between the 1988 habitat map and the resulting map reached 94.1 (out of a scale of 100). The model results indicated a slight tendency of the model to overcompensate for freshwater inputs in the form of precipitation, but the model provides an accurate representation of historical conditions. A favored mitigation measure includes incrementing freshwater discharge through the Caernarvon Diversion in response to real-time salinity monitoring. A series of alternative management scenarios were tested for future conditions (50 years) with several scenarios that included: no freshwater discharge, historical scheduled discharge (normal Caernarvon Diversion discharge 1991-2000), and water discharge under the 2001 and 2002 PULSES schedule scenarios.

CAEDYM consists of a series of mathematical equations representing the major biogeochemical processes influencing water quality. At its most basic, CAEDYM is a set of library subroutines that contain process descriptions for primary production, secondary production, nutrient and metal cycling, and oxygen dynamics and the movement of sediment.     CAEDYM configuration is flexible so that the user can focus on the processes of interest. For example, the model can be configured for a simple set of nutrients-phytoplankton-zooplankton. By simulating several state variables at the species level, CAEDYM can be used to support the understanding and management of a system. In addition, the model can be coupled to the one-dimensional hydrodynamic model (DYRESM) for studies of the seasonal, annual or decadal variation in water quality. For more detailed spatial information, CAEDYM can be run with the three-dimensional hydrodynamic model ELCOM. To maximize speed and memory requirements CAEDYM shares a common internal data structure with both DYRESM and ELCOM.

The Conservation Area Landscape Model (CALM) is a spatial ecological model of WCA2A at a higher spatial resolution than the Everglades Landscape Model (ELM) (1,734 0.25km2 cells vs 10,264 1.0 km2 ELM cells). The CALM contains a unit model, The General Ecosystem Model (GEM) identical to the ELM and has the same forcing functions where appropriate, e.g., structure inflows and one station of precipitation. Due to the significantly higher quality/quantity of data for WCA2A (and faster runtime), the CALM is being used as the test platform for debugging and calibrating much of the ecological (including hydrologic) components of the larger ELM. Whereas the CALM has a relatively simple canal configuration, the ELM contains the complex canal/levee network, with structure flows that are determined by either historical data or management rules (all database driven instead of hard coded).   Some Sensitivity Results   For the bulk of the analyses of ecological sensitivity at the spatially explicit scale, we used the CALM. For this document, we include a couple of examples of the CALM response to varying some of the ecological parameters.   The best parameter estimates were used in the nominal runs, and the state variable responses at the end of one-year model runs using low and high parameter values were compared to those nominal runs. These comparisons are presented in a series of landscape snapshots for some of the important landscape driver variables. The snapshots below show the change in the state variable relative to the nominal run, with the left column of snapshots representing the change in the state variable when the parameter was decreased, and the right side representative of changes due to increases in the parameter. Whereas white represents no change between the nominal and the altered-parameter runs, a blue pixel indicates that the nominal run had lower values (in percent) of the state variable compared to the run with the parameter change, and a red pixel indicates that the state variable was higher in the nominal run compared to that of the run with the changed parameter.",,"Raster-GIS (Grids, pixels)",,,,fortran77,,http://ecobas.org/www-server/index.html,,Simulative prediction,Single computer/PDA,,"Water, catchment (examples: hydrological, water pollution) , Ecosystem (examples: food chains, natural communities, biotopes)",,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stands are described by the number of trees per unit area in each of 19 size classes in the following species groups: hardwood and softwood. CalPro allows managers to predict stand development by year and for many decades from a specific initial state. Users can choose cutting regimes by specifying the interval between harvests (cutting cycle) and a target distribution of trees remaining after harvest. A target distribution can be a BDq distribution or any other desired distribution. Diameter-limit cuts can also be simulated.

327,CANVAS,CANVAS,"Park, N-S., T.N. Blandford, Y-S",,"Keywords: soil, water,virus transport, unsaturated, saturated, flow, solute transport, richards equatin, convection-dispersion equation   CANVAS is a composite analytical-numerical (FE) code for simulation of transport and fate of viruses in ground water. The code supports transient one-dimensional vertical flow and transport in the unsaturated zone and two-dimensional horizontal flow and transport in the saturated zone. It takes into account advection and dispersion of viral particles in the unsaturated and saturated zones, adsorption, inactivation (die-off) and colloidal filtration. CANVAS may also be used for delineation of ground-water pathlines and well capture zones. Both areal and line sources of various shapes in unconfined or confined aquifers can be accommodated. Barrier or stream boundary conditions that exist over the entire aquifer depth can also be simulated. CANVAS consists of various modules. The USCOL module simulates the flow of ground-water and the transport of viruses from a viral source to the water table. The viral breakthrough curve at the water table computed with this module is used as input for the LTG2D module. The USCOL module uses a semi-analytical technique to solve the one-dimensional, steady-state flow equation together with the Newton-Raphson method to find the non-linear roots of the equation. For the transport equation, a numerical approximation is obtained using an upstream-weighted finite element method and linear elements. Time integration is performed using a central difference formulation. SZFLOW computes steady-state, two-dimensional (areal) ground-water flow velocities within each (rectangular) finite element of the specified grid. This module also delineates ground-water flow pathlines and well capture zones. The modules uses the Laplace Transform Galerkin (LTG) technique for solution of the flow equation. LTG2D simulates two-dimensional transport of viruses in the saturated zone, using output of USCOL and SZFLOW as input. Steady-state transport is solved using the standard upstream-weighted residual finite element scheme. In its present configuration, the model handles up to a 75 X 75 grid, 10 sources, 10 soil layers, 25 pumping wells, 5 recharging wells, and 10 forward-tracked and 10 reverse-tracked pathlines.   The preprocessor, PRECV, allows the user to efficiently enter and edit input data and includes the graphical construction of the finite element grid and the placement and removal of multiple sources and pumping and injection wells. The postprocessor, CVGRAF, allows the graphical presentation of ground-water pathlines, viral breakthrough curves at the water table or at pumping wells, and ground-water pressures and saturations in the unsaturated zone beneath contaminant sources.",,Non_GIS,,"Disease hazards (examples: rabies, malaria, lyme disease, tuberculosis), Physical hazards (examples: fires, floods, air quality, water quality, carbon storage)",,FORTRAN,"Fossil fuel combustion, vegetation properties, rate of deforestation, ocean circulation, atmosphere-ocean exchange rate.   Number of inputdata: About 100",http://ecobas.org/www-server/index.html,,Simulative prediction,Single computer/PDA,Research (descriptive),"Water, catchment (examples: hydrological, water pollution) , Soil and rock (examples: erosion, fertility, compaction)",Short-term,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was originally developed for deciduous forest stands. Four compartments are defined in the model, between which all carbon fluxes are evaluated: a green compartment of organs with large mass fluctuations like leaves and fine roots, a non-green phytomass compartment (stem, branches, woody roots), a litter compartment, and the atmosphere as an infinite source and sink of carbon. CARDYN calculates the carbon dynamics of a forest stand on an hourly basis using a simple big-leaf model of the canopy. The dynamics of carbon are driven with remotely sensed values of fAPAR (fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation). Also, photosynthesis is dependent on air temperature and CO2 content of the atmosphere. It is calculated using a Farquhar type of model, the CO2 fertilization effect being modelled directly. Allocation to green and non-green phytomass follows a (constant proportion) changing proportion approach according to phase-space control principles. The changing proportion is not controlled by nutrient or water supply, but by fAPAR temporal evolution determined from remote sensing. Litter fall is also assumed to be a constant fraction of the green and non-green phytomass. Litter carbon is decomposed dependent on temperature.

Each model contains ``active'', ``data'', or ``dead'' component versions allowing for a variety of ``plug and play'' combinations. The active dynamical models consume substantial amounts of memory and CPU time and produce large volumes of output data. The data-cycling models (data models), on the other hand, are small, simple models which simply read existing datasets that were previously written by the dynamical models and pass the resulting data to the coupler. These data-cycling components are very inexpensive to run and produce no output data. For these reasons they are used for both test runs and certain types of model simulation runs. Currently, the data models run only in serial mode on a single processor. The dead models are simple codes that facilitate system testing. They generate unrealistic forcing data internally, require no input data and can be run on multiple processors to simulate the software behavior of the fully active system.",,,,,,,,http://www.ccsm.ucar.edu/models/ccsm3.0/,,,,,"Atmosphere including weather (examples: air pollution, noise pollution)",,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,

The producer submodel may be a grassland/crop, forest or savanna system, with the flexibility of specifying potential primary production curves representing the site-specific plant community. CENTURY was especially developed to deal with a wide range of cropping system rotations and tillage practices for system analysis of the effects of management and global change on productivity and sustainability of agroecosystems.    Version 4 of the model integrated the effects of climate and soil driving variables and agricultural management to simulate carbon, nitrogen, and water dynamics in the soil-plant system. Simulation of complex agricultural management systems including crop rotations, tillage practices, fertilization, irrigation, grazing, and harvest methods is now possible.    Version 5 includes a layered soil physical structure, and new erosion and deposition submodels. The model code has been rewritten in C++, reorganized, and modified to use platform-independent configuration and output files. Added to this version is graphical-user interface providing ease of configuration and running CENTURY simulations, the Century Model Interface.    The CENTURY model embodies our best understanding to date of the biogeochemistry of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulphur. The primary purposes of the model are to provide a tool for ecosystem analysis, to test the consistency of data and to evaluate the effect of changes in management and climate on ecosystems. Evolution of the model will continue as our understanding of biogeochemical processes improves.

161,Coupled heat and mass transfer model for soil-plant-atmosphere system,COUPMODEL,,,"Purpose  To quantify and increase the understanding concerning basic hydrological and biological processes in the soil-plant-atmosphere system.    The model simulates soil water and heat processes in many type of soils; bare soils or soils covered by vegetation. The basic structure of the model is a depth profile of the soil. Processes such as snow-melt, interception of precipitation and evapotranspiration are examples of important interfaces between soil and atmosphere. Two coupled differential equations for water and heat flow represent the central part of the model. These equations are solved with an explicit numerical method. The basic assumptions behind these equations are very simple:    · (i) The law of conservation of mass and energy and    · (ii) flows occur as a result of gradients in water potential (Darcy's Law) or temperature (Fourier's law).    The calculations of water and heat flows are based on soil properties such as: the water retention curve, functions for unsaturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity, the heat capacity including the latent heat at thawing/melting and functions for the thermal conductivity. The most important plant properties are: development of vertical root distributions, the surface resistance for water flow between plant and atmosphere during periods with a non limiting water storage in the soil, how the plants regulate water uptake from the soil and transpiration when stress occurs, how the plant cover influences both aerodynamic conditions in the atmosphere and the radiation balance at the soil surface.    All of the soil-plant-atmosphere system properties are represented as parameter values. Meteorological data are driving variables to the model. Most important of those are precipitation and air temperature but also air humidity, wind speed and cloudiness are of great interest. Results of a simulation are such as: temperature, content of ice, content of unfrozen water, water potential, vertical and horizontal flows of heat and water, water uptake by roots, storages of water and heat, snow depth, water equivalent of snow, frost depth, surface runoff, drainage flow and deep percolation to ground water.    In addition to the water and heat conditions also the plant dynamics and related turnover of nitrogen and carbon may be simulated. The abiotic and biotic processes may be linked in different ways also to handle the feedback between the physical driving forces and the plant development.",,,,"Agriculture & apiculture (examples: arable farming, animal husbandry, horticulture, olive production, pollination, biofuels)",,,"precipitation and air temperature but also air humidity, wind speed and cloudiness.",http://www.lwr.kth.se/Vara%20Datorprogram/CoupModel/,,"Other: please specify (e.g. EDSS, creative space, expert system etc)",Single computer/PDA,,"Water, catchment (examples: hydrological, water pollution) , Soil and rock (examples: erosion, fertility, compaction)",,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,x,,,,,,,

This allows different modelling teams to share software for the calculation of specific processes, independently of the programming language preferred, and enabling bidirectional code reutilisation. The EcoDynamo shell manages the graphical user interface, the communications between classes and the output devices, where the simulation results are saved. Simulated processes include:  (i) hydrodynamics of aquatic systems – water elevations, current speeds and directions;  (ii) thermodynamics - energy balances between water and atmosphere and water temperature;  (iii) biogeochemical - nutrient and biological species dynamics;  (iv) anthropogenic: e.g. biomass harvesting.",,,,"Physical hazards (examples: fires, floods, air quality, water quality, carbon storage), Aquaculture & commercial fishing (examples: salmon farming, ostreiculture), Biodiversity conservation (examples: protection, reserves, re-introduction, alien species)",,C++,,https://bdigital.ufp.pt/dspace/bitstream/10284/826/3/ecodynamo.pdf,,Simulative prediction,,,"Water, catchment (examples: hydrological, water pollution)",,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,

Dynamically-coupled transport equations for turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent length scale, salinity and temperature are also solved. The EFDC model allows for drying and wetting in shallow areas by a mass conservation scheme. The physics of the EFDC model and many aspects of the computational scheme are equivalent to the widely used Blumberg-Mellor model and U. S. Army Corps of Engineers\\\\\\\'Chesapeake Bay model.

In the open lake, living and dead plankton comprise the majority of suspended particles and generate significant autochthonous loads of particulate and dissolved carbon (POC and DOC) to which PCBs and other contaminants preferentially partition (Richardson et al., 1983; DePinto et al., 1993). The ESD model simulates the non-conservative, seasonally-variable dynamics of the biotic organic carbon pool, which has a significant influence upon partitioning of HOCs (Dean et al., 1993). Such a model was applied to simulate the dynamics of organic carbon states in Green Bay as part of the GBMBS (De Pinto et al., 1993). However, a more resolute, multi-class eutrophication model (Bierman and McIlroy, 1986) will be applied to Lake Michigan, and the linkage between plankton and organic carbon states will be refined. Model outputs include autochthonous solids loads (primary production), and transformation and decay rates, that will be used as input for the sediment transport and the contaminant transport and fate models. The biomass growth rates may also be linked to the plankton bioconcentration submodel of the food web bioaccumulation model (Richardson et al., 1983; DePinto et al., 1993; Dean et al., 1993; De Pinto et al., 1993).",Universal,,,"Wild vegetal products (examples: reeds, fungi, berries, flowers, sap, medical)",,,,http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/lmmb/eut.html,"Microsoft (Windows, Silverlight, .net etc)",Simulative prediction,,"Research (descriptive), Education and learning","Vegetation including fungi (examples: genetics, species, populations, guilds, habitats), Fauna (examples: genetics, species, populations, guilds)",,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,

The system consists of modular model components for soil water flow, for soil heat and N transport and for crop growth. These components are built up of different standardized model units representing each a single process as N mineralization for N transport or root water uptake for crop growth. The modular structure allows an easy exchange of model units to compare different submodels or model algorithms describing the same process. For each component and model unit several distinct interchangeable submodels are available and additional user defined submodels can be included easily by the supported use of dynamic link libraries. This enables the user to analyse the impact of different or new modelling approaches on the simulation results component by component. By the modular structure Expert-N is also an extremely flexible simulation model for N dynamics in soil-plant systems, which can be easily adapted to the actual simulation purpose including management or research, to the specific site conditions involving crop, soil and agricultural practice and to the quality and availability of data. Based on a user friendly graphical interface, a windows system for personal computers, Expert-N comprises a menu driven interactive input system to enter all necessary soil, weather, fertilizer and crop data for a particular field and growing season. This and an online help function offering detailed documentations for every model unit allows even users with minimal computing experience to apply Expert-N and to calculate the mass balance and turnover of N in soils.

236,Korea-East-Yellow Seas Model,KEY,Moon-Sik Suk,mailto:mssuk@key.kordi.re.kr,"The purpose of this study is for operational task to examine the spatio-temporal distribution of the concentrations of pollutants incoming to the sea. Model results are to be served as a given environmental dynamical oceanographic condition, and the information of the circulation and dispersion environments. This kind of experiment should be realistic as much as possible with the actual state-of-the-art. Thus a more improved three-dimensional model with real-time forcing is required to correspond to the need of high-resolution information near the source of pollutants. Local approach for a limited region has an intrinsic limitation since sea-water movements are not confined only to the inner sea, e.g., near bay or estuaries but open to any place of the outer sea. Therefore, it should be noticed that ocean circulation must be computed by a basin-scale model. Meso-scale phenomena in the ocean are not only fundamental to predict the ocean circulation but also need to be resolved from the ocean management point of view. Any limited regional approach can be carried out simply by extracting the objective domain from the [K E Y] grid system (Suk et al 1996), and the results are to be easily compared with those obtained from different model domain. In this study, a newly-improved circulation model for the East Sea (EC) is presented, which is a three-dimensional, data assimilating and eddy-resolving model corresponding to the need of high-resolution information about the sea.        Model and Results",Universal,,,"Physical hazards (examples: fires, floods, air quality, water quality, carbon storage)",,,,http://dino.wiz.uni-kassel.de/model_db/mdb/key.html,"Microsoft (Windows, Silverlight, .net etc)",Simulative prediction,,"Research (descriptive), Management, Education and learning","Water, catchment (examples: hydrological, water pollution) , Ecosystem (examples: food chains, natural communities, biotopes)",,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,

The catchment is described by an abstraction into a tree-like network sequence of surfaces and channels. Infiltration is described by a model which includes small-scale spatial variability, a crust layer, and treatment of redistribution during rain hiatus (Corradini et al., 1994). Runoff is routed with an implicit finite difference solution of the kinematic wave equation. Erosion is simulated as a simple transport process operating with erosive detachment from splash and hydraulic sources, in equilibrium with settling based on particle fall velocity.

LEACHM was developed by John Hutson and Jeff Wagenet, in the Department of Soil, Crop and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. It has undergone numerous extensions and revisions since 1984, many of these in response to the requirements and experience of users around the world. The LEACHM suite consists of four simulation models and several utilities. The simulation models utilize similar numerical solution schemes to simulate vertical water and chemical movement. They differ in their description of chemical equilibrium, transformation and degradation pathways. LEACHW describes the water regime only. The other simulations describe pesticides (LEACHP), nitrogen and phosphorus (LEACHN), and salinity in calcareous soils (LEACHC). The models simulate chemical fate and transport in transient-flow field situations as well as in laboratory columns subject to steady-state or interrupted flow. Water flow and solute transport is described by the Richards and convective-dispersion equations, or by a modified Addiscott mobile/immobile capacity (tipping-bucket) concept. (Source of abstract: http://fiams.es.flinders.edu.au/LeachmDownload/LEACHWEB.HTM)  LEACHM requires several soil parameters as input (physical properties, bulk density, particle size distribution, water retention characteristic). It also requires the amount of nitrogen and phosphate, daily maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration estimates. The model predicts amount of chemical leaching below the root zone and amount taken up by the plants.

The model keeps track of the amount of water in the puddled layer by book-keeping of the inputs (rainfall, irrigation) and outputs (evaporation, transpiration, seepage and percolation). The model can handle irrigated and rainfed conditions. In the irrigated situation, irrigation is treated as a dynamically simulated variable: a fixed amount of irrigation water is applied whenever the simulated depth of ponded water drops below a - user-defined - minimum level. When the soil dries out (rainfed situation), the puddled layer shrinks linearly with (decreasing) water content. Cracks can develop that penetrate the compacted layer in the bottom of the puddled layer at a certain minimum water content value. Water losses by seepage and percolation are then determined by the drainage rate of the subsoil below the puddled layer. Both shrinkage and cracking are irreversible. Roots of the rice crop are considered to be confined to the puddled layer only and no water extraction of the subsoil is simulated.",Universal,,,"Agriculture & apiculture (examples: arable farming, animal husbandry, horticulture, olive production, pollination, biofuels)",Easy-to-use,FORTRAN-77,,http://dino.wiz.uni-kassel.de/model_db/mdb/lowbal1.html,"Microsoft (Windows, Silverlight, .net etc)","Other: please specify (e.g. EDSS, creative space, expert system etc)",,"Research (descriptive), Education and learning","Soil and rock (examples: erosion, fertility, compaction), Ecosystem (examples: food chains, natural communities, biotopes)",,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,x,,,,,,,

29,MABES,MABES,,,"Many ecosystem services are delivered by organisms that depend on habitats that are segregated spatially or temporally from the location where services are provided. Management of mobile organisms contributing to ecosystem services requires consideration not only of the local scale where services are delivered, but also the distribution of resources at the landscape scale, and the foraging ranges and dispersal movements of the mobile agents. We develop a conceptual model for exploring how one such mobile-agent-based ecosystem service (MABES), pollination, is affected by land-use change, and then generalize the model to other MABES. The model includes interactions and feedbacks among policies affecting land use, market forces and the biology of the organisms involved. Animal-mediated pollination contributes to the production of goods of value to humans such as crops; it also bolsters reproduction of wild plants on which other services or service-providing organisms depend. About one-third of crop production depends on animal pollinators, while 60-90% of plant species require an animal pollinator. The sensitivity of mobile organisms to ecological factors that operate across spatial scales makes the services provided by a given community of mobile agents highly contextual. Services vary, depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources surrounding the site, and on biotic interactions occurring locally, such as competition among pollinators for resources, and among plants for pollinators. The value of the resulting goods or services may feed back via market-based forces to influence land-use policies, which in turn influence land management practices that alter local habitat conditions and landscape structure. Developing conceptual models for MABES aids in identifying knowledge gaps, determining research priorities, and targeting interventions that can be applied in an adaptive management context.",Universal,Non_GIS,Individual/cell-based (agents)?

254,Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments,MAGIC,Dr. Richard F. Wright,,"MAGIC is a lumped-parameter model of intermediate complexity (Cosby et al. 1985a,b) that is calibrated to the watershed of an individual lake or stream and then used to simulate the response of that system to changes in atmospheric deposition. MAGIC includes a section in which the concentration of major ions is governed by simultaneous reactions involving sulfur adsorption, cation weathering and exchange, aluminum dissolution/precipitation/speciation, and dissolution/speciation of inorganic carbon. A mass balance section of MAGIC calculates the flux of major ions to and from the soil in response to atmospheric inputs, chemical weathering inputs, net uptake in biomass and losses to runoff. Model calibration to a specific catchment is accomplished by specifying deposition and hydrological forcing functions, setting the values of those parameters that can be measured (fixed parameters), and determining the values of the remaining parameters that cannot be measured (adjustable parameters) through an optimization routine. The adjustable parameters are modified to give the best agreement between observed and predicted surface water and soil chemistry (Cosby et al. 1985a,b). MAGIC is based on simultaneous reactions describing sulfate adsorption, cation exchange, dissolution -precipitation-speciation of aluminium, dissociation of organic acids and dissolution-speciation of organic carbon. Mass balances are controlled by atmospheric inputs, chemical weathering inputs, net uptake in biomass and losses to runoff. At the heart of MAGIC is the size of the pool of exchangeable base cations in the soil. As the fluxes to and from this pool change over time in response to changes in atmospheric deposition, the chemical equilibria between soil and soil solution shift producing changes in surface water chemistry. Cation exchange is modeled using equilibrium (Gaines-Thomas) equations for each base cation and aluminium. Sulfate adsorption is represented by a Langmuir isotherm. Aluminium dissolution-precipitation is assumed to be controlled by equilibrium with a solid phase of aluminium trihydroxide. Aluminium spaciation is calculated by considering hydrolysis reactions as well as complexation with sulfate and fluoride.  Model purpose MAGIC (Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments; Cosby et al., 1985a,b,c) was development to simulate the effects of acidic deposition on soils and surface waters.

190,Maximum Entropy,Maxent,,,"Based on the maximum-entropy approach for species habitat modeling. Maximum entropy modeling is a framework for integrating information from many heterogeneous information sources for classification.  The data for a  classification problem is described as a (potentially large) number of features.  These features can be quite complex and allow the experimenter to make use of prior knowledge about what types of informations are expected to be important for classification. Each feature corresponds to a constraint on the model.  We then compute the maximum entropy model, the model with the maximum entropy of all the models that satisfy the constraints.  This term may seem perverse, since we have spent most of the book trying to minimize the (cross) entropy of models, but the idea is that we do not want to go beyond the data.  If we chose a model with less entropy, we would add `information' constraints to the model that are not justified by the empirical evidence available to us. Choosing the maximum entropy model is motivated by the desire to preserve as much uncertainty as possible.",Universal,Non_GIS,"Rule-based (e.g. qualitative reasoning, rules, rates, enviromental ontologies)","Biodiversity conservation (examples: protection, reserves, re-introduction, alien species)",,,"a set of layers or environmental variables (such as elevation, precipitation, etc.), as well as a set of georeferenced occurrence locations",http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/,"Microsoft (Windows, Silverlight, .net etc)",Simulative prediction,Single computer/PDA,Research (descriptive),"Fauna (examples: genetics, species, populations, guilds)",Not specified,,,,x,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,

The physical part of the model included a hydrodynamical component derived from Saint-Venant`s equations, coupled to a transport model based on a convection-dispersion equation under uniform, unsteady flow conditions. The simulation of the biodegradation machanisms was based on biofilm kinetics. The linkage between hydrophysical and benthic mechanisms affords a dynamic description of the system. Transport modeling provides a picture in space and time of the evelution of organic carbon concentration in water. This evolution makes it possible to predict the fate of the benthic biological component. The main characteristics of the model were STATE VARIABLES: cross sectional area, discharge, organic substrate in the flow, biofilm, organic substrate, microbial biofilm biomass.

262,Multi-Component Model of Phosphorus Dynamics in Reservoirs,MCMPDR,Dr. Raymond A. Ferrara,,"The models available for simulating phosphorus dynamics and trophic states in impoundments vary widely. The simpler empirically derived phosphorus models tend to be appropriate for long-term, steady or near steady state analyses. The more complex ecosystem models, because of computational expense and the importance of input parameter uncertainty, are impractical for very long-term simulation and most applicable for time-variable water quality simulations generally of short intermediate time frames. An improved model for time variable, long-term simulation of trophic state in reservoirs with fluctuating inflow and outflow rates and volume is needed. Such a model is developed in this paper representing the phosphorus cycle in two layer (i.e. epilimnion and hypolimnion) reservoirs. The model is designed to simulate seasonally varying reservoir water quality and eutrophication potential by using the phosphorus state variables as the water quality and indicator. Long-term simulations with fluctuating volumes and variable influent an effluent flow rates are feasible and practcal.

337,Multiphase Flow and Transport of Multicomponent Organic Liquids,MOFAT22,"Draper Aden Environmental Modeling, Inc. (DAEM)",mailto:info@daem.com,"MOFAT is a two-dimensional finite element model developed for the EPA for coupled multiphase flow and multicomponent transport in 2-D planar or radially symmetric vertical sections. Flow and transport of three fluid phases - water, nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) and gas - is simulated by the program. MOFAT also handles cases in which gas and/or NAPL phases are absent in part or all of the domain at any given time. Transport of up to five partitionable species through saturated and unsaturated zones in Cartesian or radial coordinates can be investigated.  MOFAT achieves a high degree of computational efficiency by solving flow equations at each node (on the finite element mesh) only for phases that are undergoing changes in pressures and saturations above specified tolerances using a new \""adaptive solution domain\"" method. Therefore, if NAPL is absent or exists at a residual saturation, MOFAT will locally eliminate those flow equations. MOFAT analyzes convective-dispersive transport in water, NAPL, and gas phases by assuming local equilibrium or nonequilibrium partitioning among the fluid phases and with the solid phase.

Whitmore.,mailto:a.p.whitmore@ab.dlo.nl,"MOSOM is a mathematical model that was developed to describe carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in different types of soil, e.g. clay and sandy soils. Transformation rates were described by first-order kinetics. Soil organic matter is divided into four fractions (including microbial biomass pool) and three fractions of residues. The fraction of active soil organic matter was assumed to be affected by the extent of physical protection within the soil, so was the soil microbial biomass. The extent of protection influenced the steady state level of the model, and, hence, the mineralisation rates. The mineralisation rate in fine-textured soils is lower than in coarse-textured soils; in fine-textured soils a larger proportion of the soil organic matter may be physically protected. The availability of organic materials as a substrate for microorganisms is not only determined by their chemical composition, but also by their spatial distribution in the soil. In future research, attention will be paid to the effects of soil structure and soil texture and to the spatial distribution of organic materials and their decomposers.

The model uses a modular structure that makes it possible to independently simulate advection, dispersion, sink/source mixing, and chemical reactions without reserving computer memory space for unused options. Intended for use with any block-centred finite-difference flow model such as MODFLOW and is based on the assumption that changes in the concentration field will not measurably affect the flow field. This allows the user to independently construct and calibrate aflow model. MT3D retrieves the hydraulic heads and the various flow and sink/source terms saved by the flow model, automatically incorporating the specified hydrologic boundary conditions. Although the documentation describes the use of MT3D in conjunction with MODFLOW, the transport model can be linked to any other block-centred finite-difference flow model. Simulates changes in concentration of single-species miscible contaminants in ground-water considering advection, dispersion, and some simple chemical reactions (equilibrium-controlled linear or non-linear sorption and first-order irreversible decay or biodegradation).

The model consists of a number of modules which predict concentrations at a receptor due to transport in the subsurface, surface water, or air. When applying MULTIMED to Subtitle D facilities, the landfill, surface water, and air modules in the model are not accessible by the user; only flow and transport through the unsaturated zone and transport in saturated zone can be considered. A one-dimensional, semi-analytical module simulates flow in the unsaturated zone. The output from this module, water saturation as a function of depth, is used as input to the unsaturated zone transport module. The latter simulates transient, one-dimensional (vertical) transport in the unsaturated zone using either an analytical model that includes the effects of longitudinal dispersion, linear adsorption, and first-order decay or a numerical model that includes the effects of longitudinal dispersion, non-linear adsorption, first-order decay, time variable infiltration rates, and arbitrary initial conditions of chemical concentration in the unsaturated zone. The unsaturated zone transport module calculates steady-state or transient contaminant concentrations. Output from both unsaturated zone modules is used to couple the unsaturated zone transport module with the steady-state or transient, semi-analytical saturated zone transport module. The latter includes one-dimensional uniform flow, three-dimensional dispersion, linear adsorption, first-order decay, and dilution due to direct infiltration into the groundwater plume. The fate of contaminants in the various media depends on the chemical properties of the contaminants as well as a number of media- and environment-specific parameters. The uncertainty in these parameters can be quantified in MULTIMED using the Monte Carlo simulation technique. To enhance the user-friendly nature of MULTIMED, a preprocessor, PREMED, and a postprocessor, POSTMED, have been developed. The preprocessor guides the user in the creation of a correct Subtitle D input file by restricting certain options and parameters and by settingappropriate defaults.",Universal,,,"Disease hazards (examples: rabies, malaria, lyme disease, tuberculosis), Physical hazards (examples: fires, floods, air quality, water quality, carbon storage), Biodiversity conservation (examples: protection, reserves, re-introduction, alien species)",,,,http://dino.wiz.uni-kassel.de/model_db/mdb/multimed.html,"Other, please specify..., DOS",Simulative prediction,,Research (descriptive),"Economic (examples: licence fees, markets, fines, taxes, subsidies)",,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,

351,Nitrogen Crop Response Model,N_ABLE,D. J. Greenwood; C. R. Rahn; Ann Draycott; Ian Currah,mailto:duncan.greenwood@hri.ac.uk; ann.draycott@hri.ac.uk; clive.rahn@hri.ac.uk,"The Model program estimates the response of twenty four different C3 arable crops to N-fertilizer and to crop residue incorporation and the way it is affected by time, by soil type, by cultural practice and by weather. It also calculates crop nitrogen and nitrate contents, the distributions of water and nitrate down the soil profile and the amounts of nitrate leached below different depths from the soil surface. Weather files have been prepared to represent the daily mean, temperature, rainfall, and potential evaporation for different parts of the world. To run the model it is first necessary to select the most appropriate weather file and make any adjustments to monthly rainfall. Although it should therefore be possible to simulate N-response of crops grown in many countries, it must be emphasised that the validity of the model has only been tested in West Europe.  In the model the soil is visualized as consisting of 20 consecutive 5 cm thick layers. Roots develop laterally and vertically in the soil. The volume of soil from which they can extract mineral-N increases with plant mass until a stage is reached at which further root development ceases or until the roots reach a hard pan or other barrier to root penetration.  Fertilizer and crop debris are incorporated in the uppermost layers of soil. Microbial breakdown of the endogenous soil organic matter always increases soil mineral-N. But mineral-N is either produced or immobilized during the decomposition of crop debris, depending on its C/N ratio. When mineral- N is released it is first converted to ammonium-N which is then nitrified to nitrate-N, which it is assumed, is not absorbed on soil. It can be taken up by plant roots, can be leached downwards during rain or can move upwards during evaporation from the soil surface.  Crucial to the estimation of plant growth are two crop-nitrogen parameters, the critical N concentration and the maximum possible N concentration, and the way they decline with increasing plant growth. This information is provided by a file ancillary to the program. Plant growth is calculated from the daily mean air temperatures, from the plant mass per unit area, and from its N concentration relative to the critical concentration for a plant of the same weight.  To calculate crop uptake first the potential demand of the crop for nitrogen is calculated from its mass per unit area, from its N content, from the maximum possible concentration for a plant of the same mass and from the potential maximum increment in weight. Then the maximum amount of N which the plant roots can extract from soil is estimated. If this is less than crop demand then it determines uptake.  Transpiration is calculated from fractional crop cover (derived from the plant mass), the rate of loss of water from an open water surface (a component of the weather file) and the amount of water in the rooting zone. Evaporation from bare soil likewise depends soil water distribution down the profile and on the evaporative conditions.  The foregoing processes are represented by equations and the calculations are repeated for each day and for each layer of soil.  The effects of water stress are assumed to be taken account of by the input of the maximum yield. It is assumed that crop growth and thus crop demand for N is more sensitive to dry conditions than the ability of the roots to extract that demand from soil. In consequence the model does not include routines for the effects of low soil moisture content on the transport of mineral-N to the roots.  The model has been developed for use of ammonium and nitrate based fertilizers. It does not include equations for any adverse effects of fertilizer-N on plant growth such as those caused by high osmotic stress or ammonia toxicity. Nor does it deal explicitly with ammonia volatilization.",Universal,Non_GIS,,"Physical hazards (examples: fires, floods, air quality, water quality, carbon storage)",,FORTRAN,,http://dino.wiz.uni-kassel.de/model_db/mdb/n_able.html,"Microsoft (Windows, Silverlight, .net etc)",Multi-criteria analysis,,Research (descriptive),"Vegetation including fungi (examples: genetics, species, populations, guilds, habitats), Ecosystem (examples: food chains, natural communities, biotopes)",,,,,x,,,,,,x,,,,,,x,,x,x,,x,,,,,,,
352,A computer assisted learning module to model the Nitrogen Cycle in Grazed Grassland,N_CYCLE,David Lockyer,,"Introduction N CYCLE is a computer-assisted learning (CAL) module. It is a model of the nitrogen cycle which calculates the amounts of nitrogen in the major transformations of the nitrogen cycle in grazed grassland. It presents the results as a dynamic display, with which the user can interact. The calculations relate to a full grazing season. Although designed for grassland grazed by beef cattle the program allows the user to select a dairy system or a \\\\\\\'cutting only\\\\\\\' system with no grazing animals. The program is intended for use by agricultural students, scientists and advisors. Sub-models in this simulation have been derived partly from extensive studies conducted at IGER over several years and partly from other published information. The program represents in a novel way the effects of many of the relationships that govern the flow of nitrogen in a farming system. The DOS version of N Cycle is already well-established as a teaching tool. The new Windows version incorporates recent developments in the core model itself as well as simplifying the student\\\\\\\'s interactions with the model.  USING THE MODEL  There are four main components to the model:      * Site Parameters       Site-specific parameters to the model are set and adjusted using graphical controls.     * Nitrogen flux display       Once site parameters are set, the computer calculates the amount of nitrogen mineralised from the soil organic matter and the consequent fluxes of nitrogen through the various component \\\\\\\'pools\\\\\\\' of the nitrogen cycle. The results are displayed on a screen which allows some components of the model to be varied and the immediate recalculation of the model.     * Graphical output       The graphing tool added to the Windows version allows the user to selectively present the response of certain parts of the cycle to changing input parameters e.g. to study the effect on leachates of increasing fertiliser input. Both the graph and the underlying data table can be exported via the Windows clipboard for incorporation into reports.     * Context-sensitive Help       N Cycle makes extensive use of the Windows Help engine to provide both methodological help and academic support for the user.",Universal,,,"Physical hazards (examples: fires, floods, air quality, water quality, carbon storage)",,,,http://dino.wiz.uni-kassel.de/model_db/mdb/n_cycle.html,"Microsoft (Windows, Silverlight, .net etc)",Multi-criteria analysis,,Research (descriptive),"Fauna (examples: genetics, species, populations, guilds), Ecosystem (examples: food chains, natural communities, biotopes)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,

Its user-friendly interface relieves the pain of entering and editing stand inventory data, and once data are entered, a host of analytical tools are available to help understand the data. A variety of reports can be generated describing the vegetation structure, timber value, and economics of the stand. The user may apply any of a set of standard treatments to the stand or design a customized cutting scheme, and utilize one of the four incorporated stand growth simulators to show what the stand may look like in the future.  Some features of NED/SIPS are:      * User-friendly interface featuring ?pull-down? menus and context-sensitive help.     * Access to four growth and yield simulators using the same data file format. These four simulators, NE TWIGS, SILVAH, OAKSIM, and FIBER, were all developed independently by scientists with the Northeastern Station for use in the Northeast.     * Overstory summary tables for common measures of stand characteristics (that is, density, species composition, volume, and so on).     * Economic analyses of incomes and expenses over the planning horizon.  The relationship of NED/SIPS to NED: NED/SIPS is one of a group of computer programs intended to support good forest stewardship. The full set of tools is known collectively as NED, a computer-based, decision-support system being developed by the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Northeastern Forest Experiment Station.

Where the stratigraphy does not suggest a particular network configuration, a network may be specified along principal stream tubes specified with a more general three-dimensional ground-water flow code. A special application of the network topology is to analyze flow through a system of discrete fractures. The algorithm of NETFLO is based on the application of Darcy\'s Law along each member (or branch) of the network and conservation of mass at each node. The boundary conditions may be either of prescribed pressure or take the form of sources/sinks at the boundary nodes. The code is mathematically equivalent to a set of one-dimensional finite line elements with linear basis function. NETFLO outputs pressure at all nodes and velocities and fluxes in all members. Furthermore, the code determines all possible flow paths from the node representing the contaminant source (e.g., a nuclear waste repository) to the discharge node, and the pertinent mean flow, retardation factor, time of travel and path length for each path.

The model is used to interpret results of experiments on nitrogen saturation and reversibility of nitrogen saturation conducted within a gradient of N-deposition in Europe. NICCCE simulates processes such as heat transport, evapotranspiration, primary production, mineralization, decomposition, root uptake, transport of solutes, and fractionation of N and C for coniferous forest growing on a one-dimensional, multicompartment soil profile. Input data include atmospheric, and any experimental input of nitrogen compounds, as concentrations in throughfall, and canopy exchange, global short-wave radiation, precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere (Van Dam and Van Breemen, 1995).  Principles of the model: Observed and simulated nitrate concentrations in the soil solution both responded quickly to reduced input in an experiment, with N-input in throughfall excluded. Foliar d15N-concentrations decreased more slowly, and were observed to be unchanged over a 2-year period. Due to isotope fractionation processes N values of ecosystem compartments are predicted to increase for systems approaching N-saturation, due to output of nitrate and denitrification products being relatively depleted in 15N. Sensitivity analysis of the model revealed a strong onfluence of the microbial substrate-use efficiency for organic carbon on input/output budgets os N. Factors causing an increase of primary production such as increasing CO2 concentration are predicted to result in decreased nitrate concentrations.",Universal,Non_GIS,,"Physical hazards (examples: fires, floods, air quality, water quality, carbon storage), Foresty (examples: coppicing, paper, timber, charcoal, cork)",,FORTRAN,,http://dino.wiz.uni-kassel.de/model_db/mdb/niccce.html,"Microsoft (Windows, Silverlight, .net etc), Other, please specify..., DOS",Simulative prediction,,Research (descriptive),"Ecosystem (examples: food chains, natural communities, biotopes)",Not specified,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,x,x,,,,,,x,,,

379,An ecophysiological model for irrigated rice production,ORYZA1,Dr.ir. H.F.M. ten Berge,mailto:berge@ab.agro.nl,"ORYZA1 is an ecophysiological model for irrigated rice production. The main structure and basic routines are from the Wageningen models for potential production (INTERCOM - Kropff & van Laar, 1993; SUCROS - Spitters et al., 1989; van Laar et al., 1992; MACROS module L1D - Penning de Vries et al., 1989). An important advantage of the current model is that it can be used to simulate realistic yields and to assess the impact of planting date, weather, latitude at measured leaf N contents. This is in contrast to models for potential production, that have a fixed pattern of leaf photosynthesis in time. The model follows the daily calculation scheme for the rates of dry matter production of the plant organs, and the rate of phenological development. By integrating these rates over time, dry matter production of the crop is simulated throughout the growing season. The model ORYZA1 can be used as a tool in rice research for different types of studies: 1. Detailed physiological analysis of field experiments. It enables interpretation of treatment differences in yield in terms of LAI development, leaf N content, weather conditions and varietal characteristics determining physiological and morphological processes. For this purpose, detailed measurements are required on LAI and leaf N content, preferably throughout the growing season, although a single measurement at flowering can be seen as a minimum data set. 2. Extrapolation of experimental findings to other environments. Given the N content oie leaves throughout the growing season and the varietal characteristics, attainable yields can be estimated for other environments (planting date, irradiation, temperature). 3. Estimation of yield potential for a given environment (planting date, latitude, radiation, temperature, variety as input) based on the leaf N content of the highest yielding experiments. The leaf N contents measured in the recent IRRI experiments used for model development can be used as a starting point. 4.

384,Object Watershed Link Simulation,OWLS,Dr. Wilson Huaisheng Chen,mailto:wilson@hydromodel.com,"The Object Watershed Link Simulation (OWLS) Program is designed to physically and visually simulate the real time or short-term hydrological processes for small forested watersheds and to provide detailed information about watershed response to environmental changes.  Object Watershed Link Simulation (OWLS) is a physically based watershed model. In the OWLS model, a watershed is defined as a three-dimensional object with linkages between cells and their attributes (e.g., area, slope, soil type, etc.). A cell is defined as the linkages of edges and their attributes (e.g. length, slope, etc.) and an edge is defined as the linkage of nodes and their attributes (e.g., depth of soil, elevation). The watershed hydrologic components such as water depth, surface flow, etc., are features associated with the cells, edges and nodes of a watershed. Simulation of hydrologic processes across a watershed involves the calculation of flows and water balances for these cells, edges, and nodes and their linkages. Therefore, the OWLS model is a three-dimensional, object-linked, vector-based model.  OWLS includes four sub-models that focus on (1) Data Processing, (2) Geomorphology, (3) Hydrology and (4) Visualization. The Data Processing Model handles conversions of raw data from watershed surveys into OWLS format. It also handles missing data interpolation and extrapolation for air temperature, precipitation, and streamflow. The Geomorphologic Model handles the automatic watershed delineation for flowpaths, streams, and boundaries, as well as stream geometry and macropore geometry. The Hydrologic Model handles water balance, flow calculation and flow routing for the canopy, surface, subsurface and macropore system associated with each cell. The Visualization Model handles 3-D watershed projection, 2-D watershed projection, hydrograph presentation, and 3-D dynamic watershed animation for simulated flows and other hydrologic components of the Hydrologic Model.  The OWLS model was tested with data from the Bear Brook Watershed of Maine (BBWM).

385,A simulation model for cotton crop management.,OZCOT,Dr. A.B. Hearn,,"A simple temperature driven model of the fruiting dynamics (Hearn & Da Rosa, 1985) was linked to the widely used Ritchie (1972) soil water balance model. The function describing the processes in the fruiting model were made sensitive to solar radiation, water and nitrogen stress and water logging, and a leaf area generator, a boll growth model and an elementary nitrogen model were included. The model can be used for dryland and irrigated crops, and for specific historical crops with given sowing and irrigation dates, or the model can simulate the sowing and irrigation date decisions. Output at the end of the season consists of yield and yield components, nitrogen uptake, seasonal evapotranspiration and the number of irrigations and amount of irrigation water. Within season, either daily or at selected intervals, output consists of numbers of squares, bolls and open bolls, leaf area index and soil water content. OZCOT is applied throughout cotton growing areas in Australia. OZCOT assumes that the soil is one of the vertisols on which cotton is usually grown in Australia, and that there is negligible deep drainage, so that any rainfall or irrigation in excess of that needed to restore the soil to the upper limit runs off. Soil water balance is too simplistic in respect to drainage and run off. The soil nitrogen model is rudimentary and not process based. The ability of OZCOT to differentiate between varieties is limited. The model does not simulate fibre quality and can only partially simulate skip-row planting configurations. Target use/user group: On-farm, consultants, extension workers, planning, research, water allocation policy.  Purpose of the model: : Management and economic decision making for cotton production at strategic and tactical levels; regional climatic analysis.

227,Prevention-Appraisal-Failure,PAF,,,"At the micro-economic level, the most used approach is known as the PAF (Prevention-Appraisal-Failure) model of quality costs, which divides production costs relevant to quality and safety into three categories:     1.Prevention costs are the costs of any action taken to investigate, prevent or reduce defects and failures. They include the costs of planning and documentation, training, maintenance, personnel incentives;   2.Appraisal costs are the costs of assessing and recording the quality achieved. These are generally the easiest to measure and include: costs of inspection and control of raw materials, ingredients and packaging, costs of in-plant process inspection, laboratory costs and recording costs;   3.Failure costs are the costs arising from failure to achieve the quality specified. They can be divided into internal and external costs, depending on whether they are produced within the plant or after the transfer of product ownership to the customer. Internal failure costs include scraps, reprocessing, additional laboratory analysis, extended cold storage, low yield. External failure costs include product rejection, detention, recall, liability, and bad publicity.   The PAF model demonstrates clearly that the failure costs decrease significantly with an increase in prevention and appraisal expenditure. But, for each process and situation, there is a point at which total quality costs will be at their lowest and any extra expenditure in prevention and/or appraisal will not bring additional quality improvement.",Universal,Non_GIS,,"Aquaculture & commercial fishing (examples: salmon farming, ostreiculture)",,,,http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/13270/en,"Microsoft (Windows, Silverlight, .net etc)",Optimization process,Single computer/PDA,"Research (descriptive), Management","Economic (examples: licence fees, markets, fines, taxes, subsidies)",Not specified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,

386,Predicting Arable Resource Capture in Hostile environments,PARCH,Dr. N.M.J. Crout,mailto:neil.crout@nottingham.ac.uk,"PARCH is a model developed for simulating the growth of sorghum in harsh environments. Its development was suported over a number of years by the UKs Overseas Development Administration (as was, now renamed DfID) through programmes managed by the Natural Resources Institute (NRI).  The PARCH model consists of 4 main sub-models:      * Crop Model     * Soil Water Balance     * Soil Nitrogen Model     * Soil Phosphorus Model   The model uses a daily time step for the simulation of crop growth. On each day, the resources of light, water and nutrients are `intercepted\' or `extracted\' and converted into assimilated dry matter. Depending upon the availability of these resources and the crop\'s ability to sequester them, its growth is considered as either light, water, or nutrient `limited\'. An index of crop stress is calculated in terms of the ratio of light to water or nutrient limited growth. This stress index is then used to control a number of the crop\'s stress responses, such as leaf rolling or increased partitioning to roots. Partitioning of resources between crop organs is calculated by empirically derived fractions which are adjusted according to growth stage and level of stress. Resources partitioned to the leaf canopy and root system add to leaf area and root length thereby feeding back into subsequent calculations for light interception and water and nutrient uptake.  Although the model is general it has been developed for applications in the dry tropics and, to emphasise this, the model has the acronym PARCH (Predicting Arable Resource Capture in Hostile environments). Therefore considerable attention has been paid to the crop\'s water supply. A multi-layer water balance simulation is a key component of the model. This simulates vertical redistribution of soil water, infiltration, drainage and soil evaporation.  Within PARCH the influence of soil nitrogen supply on crop growth can be simulated. Nitrate is distributed vertically between the soil profile layers from where it is available for both leaching and crop uptake. The mineralisation and immobilisation of nitrogen by soil organic matter is modelled using approaches derived from the CERES models (Jones & Kiniry 1986). These account for the influence of soil moisture, temperature, and C:N ratio. Crop uptake is controlled by nitrogen availability within the soil, crop root distribution and crop nitrogen content. The crops response to nitrogen deficiency is simulated using a nitrogen stress index similar in principle to the water stress index. The model allows for the addition of nitrogen, either in the form of mineral fertiliser, or as an organic manure. In the case of manures it is necessary to define the characteristics of the manure. Limitation by phosphate is also included although this is considered in less detail.  The model has been calibrated for four cultivars, CSH-6, CSH-8, M-35-1, and DK55 using data from 17 experiments selected from a larger dataset of 68 yield and 59 total biomass observations. The calibrated model has been tested against the remaining 51 yield and 42 biomass observations. Overall there is good agreement between the model and observation with the model accounting for >80% of the observed variation in crop yield and biomass with a residual standard deviation of 0.53 tha-1 for yield and 1.66 tha-1 for biomass The model shows no significant bias in prediction although there is a tendancy to underpredict yield. The model undoubtedly requires further testing of the model, in particular for situations of low yield.  A version of the model for rainwater harvesting has been developed at Newcastle University by Damion Young and co-workers: PARCHED-THIRST  A combination of the HYBRID tree/forest model with PARCH, named HyPAR (v.2.7), was developed by D.

387,PARCHED-THIRST,PARCHED-THIRST,Mark Damion Bede Young,mailto:m.d.b.young@ncl.ac.uk,"The PARCHED-THIRST Model has been developed over a period of four years with the aim of allowing users to quickly and easily simulate the most important processes in a rainwater harvesting system. It can also be applied to a range of other water conservation techniques through manipulation of its parameters. It is a process-based model with three main strengths:      * It can add value to experimental work by allowing us to extrapolate experimental results from one site to another and from one season to the next. The traditional approach to the transfer of a successful technology to other areas has been either to introduce the technique \'as is\' and see if it works. If it fails (as is often the case) it not only creates suspicion of new technologies in the minds of the recipients, but in the worst cases it can lead to serious problems for the very group it was supposed to be helping. The alternative is to repeatedly test variations of the technology at each target site. While this is less likely to lead to failure, it, like the traditional approach, is wasteful of resources. PARCHED-THIRST can reduce this waste of resources and resistance to uptake by identifying best-bet options before any money, man-power or trust is committed.     * In combination with tools such as Geographical Information Systems (see Damion Young?s homepage:current work), it can be used to identify target areas with high success and uptake potential, reducing the resources wasted in areas with little promise for the new technology.     * By creating a framework for the study of the system it forces us to identify the most important processes within a system, adding to our understanding of both the processes themselves and the interactions with the other processes which make up the system.  To facilitate its use by those with only limited computer experience, the model is programmed in Microsoft VisualBASIC which gives it an intuitive and easy to use interface:      * Main Window from where the user controls all aspects of the PARCHED-THIRST Model;     * Run-Time Window which dynamically displays progress with the simulation of a number of important crop, soil and water variables.     * Climate Generator Main Window which controls and runs all aspects of the PARCHED-THIRST Climate Generator;     * Climate Generator Summary Window where the user can compare the statistical properties of observed and generated climate data.  The main sub-models of the PARCHED-THIRST model can be listed as following:      * Climate Generator     * Infiltration/Runoff Model     * Soil-Water Model     * Crop Growth Model (PARCH)  The model is driven by daily rainfall and other agrometeorological data. In order to provide for simulation of long-term performance, the PARCHED-THIRST Climate Generator can be used to extend the available historical data. Daily rainfall values are then converted by the rainfall disaggregator into intensity data which are required by the infiltration model. The rainfall-runoff process is simulated as an infiltration excess with infiltration being determined by the Green-Ampt infiltration calculator. Because of the cost and difficulty of measuring soil hydraulic properties in the field, pedotransfer functions are included to allow for their prediction from readily-available soils data. The modified PARCH model adds soil-water redistribution and crop growth simulation routines which complete the system. RWH is simulated by having two profiles running simultaneously with runoff from the upper becoming an input for the lower of the two. Except for climate and soil texture, each profile can have different characteristics.

Processes include estimating of soil temperatures, pesticide degradation, sorption, volatilization, and estimating of potential evapotranspiration by using Haude equation. The model is an enhancement of the 1984 version of PRZM. Applications to date have mostly involved pesticide leaching scenarios on German soils. PELMO is based on R.F. Carsel\'s PRZM-Model (Carsel et al., 1984), but more processes are included because of significant limitations in PRZM. Similar to PRZM, PELMO has two major components: hydrology and chemical transport. While the hydrology component for calculating runoff and erosion is based on the USDA Soil Conservation Curve Number technique and the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (same as PRZM), the calculation of evapotranspiration is estimated by using the Haude equation (Haude, 1952) or by direct input of the potential evapotranspiration. Furthermore, PELMO calculates depth dependent temperature in soil by using daily air temperatures.

400,A program for aqueous geochemical calculations,PHREEQC,David Parkhurst,mailto:dlpark@usgs.gov,"PHREEQC is a computer program written in the C programming language that is designed to perform a wide variety of aqueous geochemical calculations. PHREEQC is based on an ion-association aqueous model and has capabilities for (1) speciation and saturation-index calculations; (2) reaction-path and advective-transport calculations involving specified irreversible reactions, mixing of solutions, mineral and gas equilibria, surface-complexation reactions, and ion- exchange reactions; and (3) inverse modeling, which finds sets of mineral and gas mole transfers that account for composition differences between waters, within specified compositional uncertainties.  METHOD PHREEQC is derived from the Fortran program PHREEQE, but it has been completely rewritten in C with the addition of many new capabilities. New features include the capabilities to use redox couples to distribute redox elements among their valence states in speciation calculations; to model ion-exchange and surface- complexation reactions; to model reactions with a fixed-pressure, multicomponent gas phase (that is, a gas bubble); to calculate the mass of water in the aqueous phase during reaction and transport calculations; to keep track of the moles of minerals present in the solid phases and determine automatically the thermodynamically stable phase assemblage; to simulate advective transport in combination with PHREEQC\'s reaction-modeling capability; and to make inverse modeling calculations that allow for uncertainties in the analytical data. The user interface is improved through the use of a simplified approach to redox reactions, which includes explicit mole-balance equations for hydrogen and oxygen; the use of a revised input that is modular and a completely free format; and the use of mineral names and standard chemical symbolism rather than index numbers. The use of C eliminates nearly all limitations on array sizes, including numbers of elements, aqueous species, solutions, phases, and lengths of character strings.  A new equation solver that optimizes a set of equalities subject to both equality and inequality constraints is used to determine the thermodynamically stable set of phases in equilibrium with a solution. A more complete Newton-Raphson formulation, master- species switching, and scaling of the algebraic equations reduce the number of failures of the numerical method in PHREEQC relative to PHREEQE.  PHREEQCI is a Windows-based graphical user interface for the geochemical computer program PHREEQC. It is a separate program that includes the PHREEQC program. PHREEQC is a multipurpose geochemical program than can perform speciation, inverse, reaction-path, and 1D advective reaction-transport modeling.

Valentine,mailto:hvalentine/ne_du@fs.fed.us,"Pipestem is a model of carbon allocation and growth that applies to even-aged, mono-specific stands of trees. A detailed description of Version 2 of the model can be found in Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 27:817-830 (1997). Pipestem has been calibrated for loblolly pine in Virginia and North Carolina.  Pipestem projects the growth and development of a model stand over time. The rate of growth of the model stand is defined as the difference between the rates of production and loss of dry matter. Dry matter is measured in units of carbon (C) and the rate of growth per unit land area is measured in units of C/ha/year. The rate of production of dry matter is defined as the difference between the rate of production of C substrate and the rate of consumption of C substrate through maintenance and constructive respiration. These metabolic rates also have dimensions of units of C/ha/year. Version 2.2 affords yearly adjustment of the rate of production of C substrate to account for the increasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.  Dry matter is divided into foliar, fine-root, and woody components. Carbon-allocation rules based on pipe-model theory are used to divide the dry-matter production into new foliar, fine-root, woody-root, and woody-stem tissue in proper proportions for functional balance. Losses of dry matter result from the turnover of foliage and fine roots, the death and self-pruning of branches associated with crown rise, and the death of trees associated with self-thinning. The latter two processes are driven by the production of dry matter. Version 2.2 affords the removal of dry matter through silvicultural thinning and pruning.  In addition to information about the carbon balance and the production of loss of dry matter, Pipestem also furnishes total basal area (m^2/ha), average tree height (m), average height to the base of a crown (m), and tree density (1/ha) on an annual basis. Estimates or measurements of these four variables (ordinarily obtained from a real stand of age one or older) suffice to initialize the model. Version 2.2 furnishes dominant tree height in addition to the other variables.  Version 2 of Pipestem runs under DOS and Windows 3.1, 95, and NT. Version 2.2 runs under Windows 95 and NT.

404,Pesticide and Industrial Chemical Risk Analysis and Hazard Assessment,PIRANHA,"Lawrence A. Burns, Ph.D",,"Purpose: PIRANHA is a computer-based ecological risk assessment tool. The system includes a Geographic Information System (GIS) based facility for locating biological resources potentially at risk from pesticides and industrial chemicals, a toxicological inferencing program for species-to-species extrapolation of acute toxicity (TIP), models for predicting ambient chemical exposures in aquatic and agro-ecosystems (PRZM and EXAMS), and bioaccumulation models for aquatic fauna (FGETS). PIRANHA functions under an interactive platform which incorporates soil, crop, pesticide property, and meteorological data bases.  Model algorithms: (This discussion is directed to the components of PIRANHA that relate to estimating exposure concentrations from agricultural chemicals.) Pesticide transport to receiving waters, via runoff and eroded sediment, is calculated using PRZM (Release 1). The creation of input files are automated by the PRZM Input Collator (PIC) which is an interactive platform that allows the user to build scenarios of interest by selecting the crop, pesticide, geographical area, soil, and meteorological period of interest. Geographical-based data is delineated at the Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) scale. Exposure concentrations in aquatic environments are predicted from EXAMSII (Version 2.94). Input Parameters: Input parameters are those required for PRZM and EXAMS which are found in separate summaries on each of these models. The PRZM input file created from PIC contains default parameters based on the selected geographic region, soil, weather station, pesticide and crop. The user must provide dates of pesticide applications, amount of applied, and depth incorporated, and the climatological period to be simulated. Default values may be changed through menu options in PIC or any standard ASCII editor (run external to PIRANHA). EXAMS input files must be created from scratch or by modifying existing example scenarios. Output Parameters: Output files are those created from PRZM and EXAMS with the additional feature that an output file from PRZM can be created to provide runoff loads directly into EXAMS. Critical Assessment: Strengths of Model: Ability to rapidly create and execute PRZM simulations, especially for users who are not proficient with DOS or FORTRAN input file formatting. Linkage of models and data bases. Use of default values provides quick, conservative estimates of leaching potential for screening purposes.  Weaknesses of Model: Must stay within confines of single meteorological station, or at least same geographic region.

Tsiplianovsky,mailto:tsyplianovsky@adm.pgu.serpukhov.su,"Cited from PLANTAGO Home-Page : \""For investigation of the space structure and consideration of interaction between genetic and demographic mechanisms of plant populations simulation model of population Plantago major was formulated.  In the demographic part of the model plant ontogeny is described in terms discrete age states. We also consider a conception of polivariance ontogeny, according to which there are some variants of ontogeny for each element. We deal with one of five types of polivariance, i.e dynamic polivariance. It implies different development rate of populaton elements and original transition from one age state to another.  We used transition matrices obtained from experiments described in detail in paper by Zukova, Komarov (1991). As result we obtained matrices determining a set of transition probabilities or limination for various densities of spacing.  Another question was to evaluate the interaction between plants of various age states. Evidently, the influence zone of a young plant is much less then that of a mature plant. We used data of expert stimation. The variant of the model deals with a simple genetic system that consists of one loci and two alleles. election and mutations are not taken into account. Plantago major is a partially self-pollinated plant, as it is known that the frequence of self-pollination is 85% (Van Dijk, 1991). The value was taken in our model. The frequency is determined by the species biology and local environs. We separate obligate (determining by species biology, and it is one of the model parameters) and competitive pollination. Competitive pollination consists of cross-pollination and competitive self-pollination. Their ratio defines local environs. The general frequency is a sum of obligate nd competitive self-pollinations.  Actually, during reproduction a pollen cloud from generative plants is formed all over the simulated area. At different points its composition and density are different and depend on local environs strongly.  ? Assuming that the distribution of pollen is normal and knowing the distances between plants we can calculate the amount of pollen that attains mother plant and determines its genetic composition. Next we determine how many descendants originate from self-pollination. Their number is different in plants of different age states (we introduce a coefficient of differential productivity). Descendant that falls into occupied place or outside the area perishes. Thus we can consider potential and real productivity. The structure of model is not constant. We intend that further development of the model will be gradually complicated. We plan to elaborate some versions of the model, each can be a task of separate investigation.\""",Universal,Non_GIS,,,,PASCAL,,http://dino.wiz.uni-kassel.de/model_db/mdb/plantago.html,"Other, please specify..., DOS",Simulative prediction,,Research (descriptive),"Fauna (examples: genetics, species, populations, guilds), Ecosystem (examples: food chains, natural communities, biotopes)",Not specified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

408,Uptake of Organic Chemicals into Plants,PLANTX,Dr. Stefan Trapp,,"The model describes the dynamic uptake from soil, solution and atmosphere, metabolism and accumulation of anthropogenic chemicals in roots, stem, leaves and fruits. It is transferable to different plant species and most (nondissociating) organic chemicals. The following processes are considered: -diffusive exchange in soil water and air pores to roots, -transfer into rootswith the transpiration stream, -translocation into stems and leaves via the transpiration stream, -partitioning into the stem, -transport into fruits via the assimilation stream, -diffusive exchange between air and leaves via stomata and cuticle, -metabolism, -dillution by growth. principles of the model Four compartments are considered, namely roots, stem, leaves and fruits. Reactions and fluxes within each comp. are assumed to be homogeneously mixed. By the mass balances in these comp. follows an inhomogeneous linear system of differential equations with constant coefficients. The partition of the chemical between plant tissue and aqueous solution is calculated by the lipid- (l_p) and the water content (W_p) of the plant and the lipophilicity of the chemical (K_{OW}).

417,WWW On-line Model of Crop Response to Potassium Fertilizer,POTASS,Duncan J. Greenwood,mailto:duncan.greenwood@hri.ac.uk,"The Potassium model calculates the effects of incorporating potassium fertilizer on the yield and potassium uptake of 13 different vegetable and arable crops. It also calculates the changes in exchangeable and in fixed soil-potassium and in the activity ratio of potassium in soil solution. The model updates the variables for each day during growth but only the values at harvest are shown in the results. A user-friendly interactive version of the model runs on-line from a World Wide Web page and immediately returns both numerical and graphical results to the user.  Model description: The crop is visualized as growing with all its roots in a single layer of soil , 0 - 30 cm, from the surface. The soil is considered to be uniform and the roots and water are considered to be uniformly distributed throughout it.  The model recalculates, the plant weight and K content and the exchangeable and fixed soil-K for each day. (Click here for a simplified flow diagram.) It first calculates the increment in growth from the current weight of the plant, the corresponding critical %K and the current %K in the plant. The increment in root length is calculated from the most recent plant weight and increment in weight using whichever of three species related relationships is most appropriate to the crop. The model calculates the potential maximum amount of K that can be transported by diffusion through soil, with a small correction for mass flow, as the sum of the amounts transported to each of the \""active\"" increments of root formed during the life of the crop; segments are considered to be fully \""active\"" for 20 days after their formation and then cease to function. The actual uptake is usually less than this potential maximum because of the suppressive effects of plant %K on uptake, which in the model is calculated from the %K in the plant and the maximum possible %K for a plant of that size. Both this maximum possible %K and the critical %K decline with increasing plant mass and the way they do so varies with the species by relationships that are embedded in the model.  The model also calculates for each day the maximum radial distance in soil round each increment of root where root absorption has induced a significant decrease in exchangeable soil-K. This distance is assumed to be the radius of the depletion zone around the segment. There is a continuous interchange between the fixed and exchangeable soil-K in these depletion zones. Also when fertilizer is applied there is a continuing interchange between fixed and exchangeable soil-K in the remainder of the soil that has not been affected by root uptake. The model re-calculates for each day the interchange between the exchangeable and fixed soil-K for the depletion zone round each root increment and in the body of the soil. It also calculates mean values of exchangeable and fixed soil-K in the rooting layer.  No correction is made in the model for loss of plant-K during senescence which can be considerable especially from cereals. Nor does the model include any relationships for uptake of K from the subsoil or for the substitution of K by Na. The initial activity ratio of the soil [K]/sqrt([Ca] +[Mg]) and its gradient with exchangeable soil K are calculated very approximately from the value for a soil containing 15 % clay, dominated by mica smectite, in the UK West Midlands and the percentage clay in the input to the model.  Full details of the model and experimental evidence on its validity are given in the three published papers cited below (see IV. References).  The Web version:  The Web version of the model is a simplification of a more sophisticated one. The simplifications include calculating the important relationships between K activity ratio and exchangeable soil-K from the clay content and assuming a constant soil water content instead of calculating it for each day from from daily inputs of weather.  The program POTASS (version 1.0) was compiled and linked from one large source module and two smaller ones. The large module embodies the potassium mathematical model itself. The two smaller modules support the model on a World Wide Web server. They incorporate the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) routines and they are connected to a system of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) files. These HTML files appear as the \'Web pages\' on the remote screens of users running the model.

The model consists of hydrologic (flow) and chemical transport components to simulate runoff, erosion, plant uptake, leaching, decay, foliar washoff, and volatilization. Pesticide transport and fate processes include advection, dispersion, molecular diffusion, and soil sorption. The model includes soil temperature effects, volatilization and vapor phase transport in soils, irrigation simulation and a method of characteristics algorithm to eliminate numerical dispersion. Predictions can be made for daily, monthly or annual output. PRZM allows the user to perform dynamic simulations considering pulse loads, predicting peak events, and estimating time-varying emission or concentration profiles in layered soils.  PRZM2 links two subordinate models in order to predict pesticide fate and transport through the crop root zone, and the unsaturated zone: PRZM and VADOFT. PRZM, VADOFT and SAFTMOD are part of RUSTIC. RUSTIC links these models in order to predict the fate and transport of chemicals to drinking water wells. The codes are linked together with the aid of a flexible execution supervisor (software user interface) that allows the user to build models that fit site-specific situations. This release of PRZM incorporates several features in addition to those simulated in the original PRZM code: specifically, soil temperature simulation, volatilization and vapor phase transport in soils, irrigation simulation, microbial transformation, and a method of characteristics (MOC) algorithm to eliminate numerical dispersion. PRZM is capable of simulating fate and transport of the parent compound and as many as two daughter species. VADOFT is a one-dimensional finite-element code which solves the Richard\'s equation for flow in the unsaturated zone. The user may make use of the constitutive relationships between pressure, water content, and hydraulic conductivity to solve the flow equations. VADOFT may also simulate the fate and transport of two parent and two daughter products. The PRZM and VADOFT codes are linked together with the aid of a flexible execution supervisor that allows the user to build loading models which are tailored to site-specific situations. In order to perform exposure assessments, the code is equipped with a Monte Carlo pre- and post-processor.  PRZM3 is the most recent version of a modeling system that links two subordinate models--PRZM and VADOFT--in order to predict pesticide transport and transformation down through the crop root and unsaturated zone.  The PRZM3 model system with documentation is available for microcomputer (DOS) systems. Enhancements to Release 3.0 include algorithms that enable modeling of nitrogen cycle soil kinetic processes with the ability to track nitrogen discharges from a septic tank into the soil environment and movement to groundwater. Additional enhancements enable better simulation of physicochemical processes, increased flexibility in representing agronomic practices, and improved post-processing and data interpretation aids.

In contrast, Q2K uses unequally-spaced reaches. In addition, multiple loadings and abstractions can be input to any reach.  •Carbonaceous BOD speciation. Q2K uses two forms of carbonaceous BOD to represent organic carbon. These forms are a slowly oxidizing form (slow CBOD) and a rapidly oxidizing form (fast CBOD). In addition, non-living particulate organic matter (detritus) is simulated. This detrital material is composed of particulate carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in a fixed stoichiometry.  •Anoxia. Q2K accommodates anoxia by reducing oxidation reactions to zero at low oxygen levels. In addition, denitrification is modeled as a first-order reaction that becomes pronounced at low oxygen concentrations.  •Sediment-water interactions. Sediment-water fluxes of dissolved oxygen and nutrients are simulated internally rather than being prescribed. That is, oxygen (SOD) and nutrient fluxes are simulated as a function of settling particulate organic matter, reactions within the sediments, and the concentrations of soluble forms in the overlying waters.  •Bottom algae. The model explicitly simulates attached bottom algae.  •Light extinction. Light extinction is calculated as a function of algae, detritus and inorganic solids.  •pH. Both alkalinity and total inorganic carbon are simulated. The river's pH is then simulated based on these two quantities.  •Pathogens. A generic pathogen is simulated.

195,Sustainable Forest Management Planning  Toolkit,SFM Toolkit,Brian R. Sturtevant,mailto:bsturtevant@fs.fed.us,"The approach inserts a meta-modeling strategy into a collaborative modeling framework grounded in adaptive management philosophy that facilitates participation among stakeholders, decision makers, and local domain experts in the meta-model building process. The modeling team works iteratively with each of these groups to define essential questions, identify data resources, and then determine whether available tools can be applied or adapted, or whether new tools can be rapidly created to fit the need. The desired goal of the process is a linked series of domain-specific models (tools) that balances generalized “top-down” models (i.e., scientific models developed without input from the local system) with case-specific customized “bottom-up” models that are driven primarily by local needs. Information flow between models is organized according to vertical (i.e., between scale) and horizontal (i.e., within scale) dimensions. We illustrate our approach within a 2.1 million hectare forest planning district in central Labrador, a forested landscape where social and ecological values receive a higher priority than economic values. However, the focus of this paper is on the process of how SFM modeling tools and concepts can be rapidly assembled and applied in new locations, balancing efficient transfer of science with adaptation to local needs. We use the Labrador case study to illustrate strengths and challenges uniquely associated with a meta-modeling approach to integrated modeling as it fits within the broader collaborative modeling framework. Principle advantages of the approach include the scientific rigor introduced by peer-reviewed models, combined with the adaptability of meta-modeling. A key challenge is the limited transparency of scientific models to different participatory groups.

181,Spatial Modeling Environment,SME3,Thomas Maxwell,mailto:tmaxwell@zoo.uvm.edu,"The SME allows a scientist to construct sophisticated models of ecosystems in a point-and-click graphical environment. An ecosystem cell model is developed using a graphical modeling tool   STELLA models can simulate photosynthesis, soil chemistry, or any other process operating in a particular kind of landscape. But in isolation, they are like symphony musicians playing in individual sound-proof rooms. The musicians may all be virtuosos, but they can't play in harmony. To behave like an ecosystem, the STELLA models have to be able to ""hear"" each other.  Villa is also gearing up to take the SME concept to the next level with a tool he has dubbed the Integrating Modeling Architecture (IMA). The IMA would allow spatial and non-spatial models to be linked together seamlessly into a high-level model. This will enable researchers to bridge very different kinds of models. For example, a model of the population dynamics of deer (modeling based on individual organisms) could be run within a model of plant growth in a forest (modeling based on a process). The different models could be defined and linked together by dragging and dropping icons on a computer desktop.     That's where the SME comes in. It provides a graphical setting for linking STELLA models into an integrated cell -- that is, a functioning patch of landscape. Each cell covers a small fraction of the total landscape. A spatial model of a forest would include one cell type to represent tree-covered ground; running in the background of the cell would be an ensemble of STELLA models for the processes at work in a forest. Other cell types might represent patches of open meadow or a lake. The cells are linked together within the SME to create an entire functioning landscape.    The SME also includes tools for visualizing and analyzing data from the model.

It incorporates the process of water uptake by roots. The soil profile is divided into several layers (containing one or more compartments of variable thickness) having different physical properties. The partial differential equation for flow in the unsaturated system is solved using an implicit finite difference scheme. An explicit linearization of the hydraulic conductivity (K) and soil water capacity (C) is used. Knowing the initial conditions (i.e. water content or pressure head distribution profile) and top and bottom boundary conditions, the system of equations for all the compartments is solved for each (variable) time step by applying the so-called Thomas tridiagonal algorithm. The integration procedure within each time step allows calculation of all water balance terms for each time period selected. For the top boundary, data on rainfall, potential soil evaporation, and potential transpiration are required. When the soil system remains unsaturated, one of three bottom boundary conditions can be used: pressure head, zero flux, or free drainage. When the lower part of the system remains saturated, one can either give the ground-water level or the flux through the bottom of the system as input. In the latter case, the ground-water level is computed. The rate of vegetation growth, both potential and actual can be simulated in the crop growth submodel which is linked to the main water model in a dynamic way. This submodel supplies information about the vegetation characteristics to the main water model throughout the simulation period.

The TEM uses spatially referenced information on climate, elevation, soils, vegetation and water availability as well as soil- and vegetation-specific parameters to make monthly estimates of important carbon and nitrogen fluxes and pool sizes of terrestrial ecosystems. The TEM operates on a monthly time step and at a 0.5 degrees latitude/longitude spatial resolution.   Improvements in computer resources have allowed us to examine ecosystem processes across the globe in more detail over time so that several versions of TEM have been developed over the past decade. At first, TEM only conducted equilibrium analyses of terrestrial carbon and nitrogen dynamics with hydrological inputs determined by an independent water balance model (WBM, Vörösmarty et al., 1989). This WBM used the same climatic data and soil-specific parameters as TEM. In version 4.0, the algorithms of the WBM were incorporated directly into TEM so that terrestrial carbon, nitrogen and water variables were determined concurrently. Then, we were then able to develop TEM 4.1 using relatively minor modifications of TEM 4.0 so that the model could conduct either equilibrium or transient analyses of terrestrial carbon and nitrogen dynamics.",Universal,Non_GIS,,"Physical hazards (examples: fires, floods, air quality, water quality, carbon storage)",,,"climate, elevation, soils, vegetation and water availability as well as soil- and vegetation-specific parameters",http://www.mbl.edu/eco42/,"Microsoft (Windows, Silverlight, .net etc)",Optimization process,Single computer/PDA,Research (descriptive),"Atmosphere including weather (examples: air pollution, noise pollution)  , Ecosystem (examples: food chains, natural communities, biotopes)",Short-term,,x,,,x,,,,,x,,,,,,x,,x,,,,,,,,,,

332,MOC,USGS 2-D Method Of Characteristics transport model,L.F. Konikow,mailto:h2osoft@usgs.gov,"MOC is a two-dimensional model for the simulation of non-conservative solute transport in saturated ground-water systems. The model is both general in its applicability and flexible in its design. Thus, it can be applied to a wide range of problems. It computes changes in the spatial concentration distribution over time caused by convective transport, hydrodynamic dispersion, mixing or dilution from recharge and chemical reactions. The chemical reactions include first-order irreversible rate reaction (such as radioactive decay), reversible equilibrium-controlled sorption with linear, Freundlich, or Langmuir isotherms, and reversible equilibrium-controlled ion exchange for monovalent or divalent ions. The model assumes that fluid density variations, viscosity changes, and temperature gradients do not affect the velocity distribution. MOC allows modeling heterogeneous and anisotropic, confined aquifers. MOC solves the ground-water flow equation and the non-conservative solute-transport equation in a step-wise (uncoupled) fashion. The computer program uses the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method or the Strongly Implicit Procedure (SIP) to solve the finite-difference approximation of the ground-water flow equation. The SIP procedure for solving the ground-water flow equation is most useful when areal discontinuities in transmissivity exist or when the ADI solution does not converge. MOC uses the method of characteristics to solve the solute transport equation. It uses a particle tracking procedure to represent convective transport and a two-step explicit procedure to solve the finite-difference equation that describes the effects of hydrodynamic dispersion, fluid sources and sinks, and divergence of velocity. The explicit procedure is subject to stability criteria, but the program automatically determines and implements the time step limitations necessary to satisfy the stability criteria. MOC uses a rectangular, block-centered finite-difference grid for flux and transport calculations. The grid size for flow and transport equations allows up to 100 rows and 100 columns. The program allows spatially varying diffuse recharge or discharge, saturated thickness, transmissivity, boundary conditions, initial heads and initial concentrations, and an unlimited number of injection or withdrawal wells. Up to five nodes can be designated as observation points for which a summary table of head and concentration versus time is printed at the end of the calculations. An interactive preprocessor, PREMOC, developed by the IGWMC and updated by the USGS, is included with the program to facilitate user-friendly data entry and editing. The program produces tabular output which can be processed in a commercial contouring package. The MOC package includes the preprocessor, PREMOC, and two versions of the MOC program, one that can handle a 40 by 40 grid and a big version that can handle a 100 by 100 grid. A batch file capability is also included for conducting multiple runs during calibration and sensitivity analysis. MOC is distributed with source code, executable image and example data sets.

The runoff component of SWMM operates on a collection of subcatchment areas on which rain falls and runoff is generated. The routing portion of SWMM transports this runoff through a conveyance system of pipes, channels, storage/treatment devices, pumps, and regulators. SWMM tracks the quantity and quality of runoff generated within each subcatchment, and the flow rate, flow depth, and quality of water in each pipe and channel during a simulation period comprised of multiple time steps.",,,,,,,,http://www.epa.gov/athens/wwqtsc/html/swmm.html,,"Other: please specify (e.g. EDSS, creative space, expert system etc)",,,"Water, catchment (examples: hydrological, water pollution) , Soil and rock (examples: erosion, fertility, compaction)",,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

228,Compensation for Wildlife Damage,,,,"The economy is made up of myopic households with open access to both land for agriculture and wildlife for animal products.3 Labor flows freely between cropping and hunting in response to profit differentials between the two sectors. The assumption that property rights over land and wildlife are not defined (or enforced) implies that the context for the model and the analysis is a less developed country, where conflicts between wildlife and farmers are most profound. We assume that land and wildlife are (1) biologically interconnected, so that the capacity of the land to support wildlife is reduced as habitat is converted to agricultural land;4 and (2) economically interconnected, in that the opportunity cost of time spent growing crops are the foregone returns from harvesting wildlife (and vice versa).  First, the model explicitly models wildlife damage and is used to analyze the consequences of introducing a  compensation scheme. Secondly, we derive the micro-foundations for macro behavior by analyzing a  general equilibrium model over time, rather than postulating demand curves for key commodities.  Within this framework, we allow the wildlife stock to change over time in response to labor allocation  and land use decisions by households",Universal,Non_GIS,"Rule-based (e.g. qualitative reasoning, rules, rates, enviromental ontologies)","Disease hazards (examples: rabies, malaria, lyme disease, tuberculosis)",,,,http://www.tri.ucalgary.ca/cree/P-Rondeau2.pdf,"Microsoft (Windows, Silverlight, .net etc)",Simulative prediction,Single computer/PDA,Research (descriptive),"Economic (examples: licence fees, markets, fines, taxes, subsidies)",Not specified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,
