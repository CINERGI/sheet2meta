 ABEL   , 07/11/2011   ,,Evaluating Claims of Inability to Pay from Corporations and Partnerships   ," Since its development in 1986, EPA staff have used the ABEL computer model extensively to evaluate  claims from defendants that they cannot afford to pay for compliance, clean-up and civil penalties. ABEL  evaluates inability to pay claims from corporations and partnerships by looking at a party’s tax return data.  ABEL also requires the user to input the cost of compliance, clean-up and a proposed civil penalty amount.  The model first conducts a cash-flow analysis of the company. Then it performs a statistical projection of  the probability the firm can afford compliance costs, clean-up costs and civil penalties. It does not require  any knowledge of accounting, finance or computers. The model is designed for settlement negotiations.  Should EPA and a party fail to agree on what the party can afford, the EPA would use an expert witness to  testify about the party's ability to pay in a trial or hearing.

",," Many of the defendants in our enforcement actions are corporations and partnerships. Most of them will at  some time claim that they cannot afford the compliance costs, penalties and/or environmental clean up.  Since most of our enforcement professionals do not have the capability of reviewing a business’ financial  records to determine the validity of this inability to pay claim, EPA developed a relatively simple tool that  can help us evaluate these claims.   "," The model first looks at the claimant’s financial resources and expenses to determine the company’s excess  annual cash flow. Then it looks at the firm’s ability to fund that compliance cost, penalty payment and/or  clean up cost from that excess cash flow over the next five years.   ", Contractor verified that calculations were similar to those an independent financial analyst might perform.  ," While the model is very helpful, it has some important limitations. First, it does no data quality checks. All  expenses are accepted at face value even if they might be unreasonable (e.g. company that sells fill dirt  claims annual entertainment expenses of $60,000). Second, it only looks at excess cash flow. It does not  look at a firm’s ability to borrow money. It does not evaluate whether any firm assets could be liquidated   (e.g. a 3,000 acre piece of prime development land worth $10,000,000 would not be included in an ABEL  analysis). Third, it assumes the firm’s income over the next 5 years will be substantially similar to the  information submitted. If the firm’s lone facility burned to the ground after the last tax year closed, and it  was an uninsured loss, the model will give an ability to pay that is artificially high. Fourth, it does not take  into account the financial strength of related entities (e.g. the firm we are suing is in poor financial  condition, but it is a wholly owned subsidiary of General Electric.)   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 AGWA  , 10/08/2009   ,, Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment  ,"  The Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment (AGWA) tool is a Geographic Information Systems  (GIS) interface jointly developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service, and the University of Arizona to automate the  parameterization and execution of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and KINematic Runoff  and EROSion (KINEROS2) hydrologic models. The application of these two models allows AGWA to  conduct hydrologic modeling and watershed assessments at multiple temporal and spatial scales. AGWA’s  current outputs are runoff (volumes and peaks) and sediment yield, plus nitrogen and phosphorous with the  SWAT model. AGWA uses commonly available GIS data layers to fully parameterize, execute, and  spatially visualize results from both SWAT and KINEROS2. Through an intuitive interface, users select an  outlet from which AGWA delineates and discretizes the watershed using a Digital Elevation Model  (DEM). The watershed model elements are then intersected with soils and land cover data layers to derive  initial estimates of requisite model input parameters. AGWA can currently use STATSGO, SSURGO and  FAO soils and nationally available land-cover/use data such as the National Land Cover Data (NLCD)  datasets. Users are also provided the functionality to easily customize AGWA for use with any classified  land-cover/use data. The chosen hydrologic model is then executed, and the results are imported back into  AGWA for visual display on the spatially distributed model elements. This allows decision-makers to  identify potential problem areas where additional monitoring can be undertaken or mitigation activities can  be focused. AGWA can difference results from multiple simulations to examine and compare changes  predicted for each alternative input scenario (e.g., climate/weather change, land-cover change, present  conditions, and alternative futures). In addition, a variety of new capabilities have been incorporated into  AGWA, including pre- and post-fire watershed assessment, watershed group simulations to cover all  watersheds within a political or management boundary, implementation of stream buffer zones, and  installation of retention and detention structures. A land-cover modification tool is provided for the  development of prescribed land-cover change scenarios, with a number of options for uniform, spatially  random, and patchy change to single or multiple land-cover classes. There are currently two versions of  AGWA available: AGWA 1.5 for users with Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) ArcView   3.x GIS software (ESRI, 2005), and AGWA 2.0 for users with ESRI ArcGIS 9.x (ESRI, 2006).

 AIR 3D  , 11/23/2009   ,, AIR 3D  ,"  AIR3D is a sequence of computer codes that adapt the ground-water-flow simulator MODFLOW  (McDonald, M.G, and Harbaugh, A.L., 1988, A modular three-dimensional finite-difference ground-water  flow model: U.S. Geological Survey Techniques of Water-Resources Investigations, book 6, chap. A1, 586  p.) to simulate air flow in the unsaturated zone. This software package can be used to simulate  three-dimensional air flow in a heterogeneous, anisotropic, unsaturated domain where air flow is induced  through dry wells or trenches, as in vapor-extraction remediation. Although the code was developed  primarily for this purpose, it also can be used to simulate natural air flow in the unsaturated zone caused by  atmospheric-pressure variations. In this application, elevation-head and temperature gradient terms are  assumed to be negligible compared to pressure-gradient terms; therefore, AIR3D may not be appropriate  for simulating natural flows in deep unsaturated systems.   A preprocessor (PREAIR) uses pneumatic and geologic information to create data files in a format  consistent with MODFLOW input requirements. MODFLOW can be used to numerically solve the  partial-differential equation governing air flow because the air-flow equation has been cast in a format  consistent with the ground-water-flow equation. A postprocessor (POSTAIR) then transforms output from  MODFLOW into dimensionally consistent air-flow output--pressure, mass flow rates, and volumetric flow  rates.   MODFLOW is adapted by matching coefficients of the general, three-dimensional, transient air-flow  equation with those of the ground-water-flow equation. The application of boundary conditions for air flow  is facilitated by AIR3D. The approach retains the original MODFLOW features that permit solution of a  model describing three-dimensional flow in heterogenous, anisotropic domains.   The preprocessor PREAIR and postprocessor POSTAIR are written in Fortran 77 and will run, with minor  modification, on most computers with a Fortran compiler. PREAIR, MODFLOW, and POSTAIR exchange  text and binary-data files and, therefore, all must be compiled with the same compiler.

",,"  AirControlNET provides extensive coverage of all the U.S. criteria pollutant emission sources as found in  the 2002 NEI and potential control measures for reducing such emissions. This source coverage is for four  different base years (1996, 1999, 2001, and 2002) and for future years projected from 2002 (2015 and  2020). The emission inputs to AirControlNET are essentially all emissions data from the NEI. The NEI  Input Form (or NIF) has a list of this data at http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/net/neiwhatis.html. (Note: this  list is also in the Development Report for AirControlNET). In addition, mercury emissions data is taken  from an emissions inventory prepared for the 2003 Clear Skies analyses (documented at  www.epa.gov/clearskies). Organic and elemental carbon emissions data are derived from PM data used in  the NEI and calculated using the SPECIATE 4.0 database.   The model can distinguish between fuel types for different sources, and can be applied at the following  geographic levels: national, regional (11 regions are built into the model, including the Eastern and  Western US), State, MSA/CMSAs, and county. The model can also be applied at an industry (SIC or  NAICS) or sector (source and fuel type) level. There is an extensive dataset of emissions control measures  for all pollutants included in the model.

",  A user needs a basic understanding of emissions inventory and control measure data to competently  operate the AirControlNET tool.   ,,"  AirControlNET was developed to apply control strategies for reduction of criteria pollutant and mercury  emissions in order to provide US EPA the capability to estimate impacts of such control strategies applied  to non-EGU point and area sources. These analyses are often included in Regulatory Impact Analyses  (RIAs) for National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and criteria pollutant implementation rules  prepared by EPA. In addition, AirControlNET has been used by Regional Planning Organizations (RPOs)  for technical analyses and by States for SIP development.   ","  AirControlNET is a database and model that generates impacts such as emission reductions and costs from  applications of control strategies. This can be done directly in the control scenarios module, or this can be  done under the presumption of least-cost behavior in the least-cost module. The model considers  source-specific data such as capacity, flow rate, and (if desired) the annual costs per ton emission reduction  for a measure when estimating the degree of control and cost. The least-cost modeling is based on  employing a formulation to find the set of control measures that can reduce emissions by a certain  percentage or by a certain tonnage at the least annual cost.   These measures can be part of control strategies applied at many different specific geographic areas.  Among the regions within AirControlNET are those for various regional haze planning bodies, air planning  consortiums (e.g., Ozone Transport Commission (OTC), Southern Appalachian Mountain Initiative  (SAMI)), as well as the Eastern and Western US.   AirControlNET provides extensive detail on existing control measures, including ranges of costs (capital  and annual) and control efficiencies. This data comes from EPA technical documents and other recent  literature that is, in large part, peer reviewed.   ","  Evaluations are performed when model parameters are updated (e.g., if a new emissions inventory is  included, or if new control measures data is added) or modeling capabilities are enhanced. Many of these  evaluations are associated with large-scale analytical efforts such as those required for NAAQS RIAs. EPA  has prepared internal sensitivity analyses examining the impact of input parameter variation, and would  prepare similar sensitivity analyses during model applications.    ",  A key limitation to AirControlNET is that it is a static model. It does not incorporate multi-year effects or  account for dynamic effects due to changes in a stream of costs or underlying parameters.   ,  AirControlNET was used in preparing the non-EGU point source control strategies analysis for the BART   RIA prepared in 2005 (available in Chapter 8 of the report at  http://www.epa.gov/oar/visibility/pdfs/bart_ria_2005_6_15.pdf.

Atmosphere-Ocean, 33 (4),  683-730):  “A new coupled atmosphere-ocean model has been developed for climate predictions at decade to century  time scales. The atmospheric model is similar to that of Hansen et al. [1983] except that the atmospheric  dynamic equations for mass and momentum are solved using Arakawa and Lamb's [1977] C grid scheme,  and the advection of potential enthalpy and water vapor uses the linear upstream scheme [Russell and  Lerner, 1981]. The new global ocean model conserves mass, allows for divergent flow, has a free surface  and uses the linear upstream scheme for the advection of potential enthalpy and salt. Both models run at 4°  × 5° resolution, with 9 vertical layers for the atmosphere and 13 layers for the ocean. Twelve straits are  included, allowing for subgrid-scale water flow. Runoff from land is routed into appropriate ocean basins.  Atmospheric and oceanic surface fluxes are of opposite sign and are applied synchronously. Flux  adjustments are not used. Except for partial strength alternating binomial filters [Shapiro, 1970] which are  applied to the momentum components in the atmosphere and oceans, there is no explicit horizontal  diffusion.”  For additional general information, see http://aom.giss.nasa.gov/GEN/OVERVIEW.AOM   ",  ,,"  EPA contact: Brooke L.

AQUATOX predicts the fate of various pollutants,  such as nutrients and organic chemicals, and their effects on the ecosystem, including fish, invertebrates,  and aquatic plants. This model is a valuable tool for ecologists, biologists, water quality modelers, and  anyone involved in performing ecological risk assessments for aquatic ecosystems.   AQUATOX simulates the transfer of biomass, energy and chemicals from one compartment of the  ecosystem to another. It does this by simultaneously computing each of the most important chemical or  biological processes for each day of the simulation period. AQUATOX can predict not only the  environmental fate of chemicals in aquatic ecosystems, but also their direct and indirect effects on the  resident organisms. Therefore it has the potential to establish causal links between chemical water quality  and biological response and aquatic life uses.

 ARAMS  , 11/16/2009   ,, Army Risk Assessment Modeling System   ,"  The U.S. Department of Defense and the Army conduct risk assessments to determine safe levels and  cleanup target levels for military relevant compounds (MRCs) and to evaluate remediation alternatives to  provide the most cost-effective approach to reach target levels. As part of the Army’s Installation  Restoration Research Program (IRRP), the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center  (ERDC) is developing a computer-based, modeling- and database-driven analysis system for estimating  human and ecological health impacts and risks associated with MRCs. The Adaptive Risk Assessment  Modeling System (ARAMSTM) is based on a widely accepted risk paradigm that integrates exposure and  effects assessments to characterize risk.   Objective: To develop a computer-based decision support system that integrates multimedia fate/transport,  exposure, intake/uptake, and effect of military relevant compounds, explosives, and depleted uranium to  assess human and ecological probabilistic risks.   Overall Approach: ARAMSTM Incorporates various existing databases and models for exposure,  intake/uptake, and effects (health impacts) into a conceptual site modeling framework. With ARAMSTM,  the user has the flexibility to visually specify, through objects, multimedia pathways and risk scenarios.  Also, the user can choose which particular model or database to use for each object. Thus, the heart of  ARAMS TM is the object oriented Conceptual Site Model (CSM). The CSM is based on the Framework for  Risk Analysis in Multimedia Environmental Systems (FRAMES) developed by Battelle’s Pacific  Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in cooperation with the   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It includes the MEPAS suite of models.  Both screening-level and focused assessments need to be conducted. Screening-level assessments are those  that can be conducted rather quickly with limited data at low cost, whereas focus assessments require more  time, cost, and data, but they should provide more definitive information. Thus, the overall strategy for  ARAMSTM development is to build the system in two stages, the first stage for screening assessments and  the second stage for focus assessments.

 ATTILA   , 11/16/2009   ,, Analytical Tools Interface for Landscape  Assessments   ,"  Environmental management practices are trending away from simple, local-scale assessments toward  complex, multiple-stressor regional assessments. Landscape ecology provides the theory behind these  assessments while geographic information systems (GIS) supply the tools to implement them. A common  application of GIS is the generation of landscape metrics, which are quantitative measurements of the  environmental condition or vulnerability of an area (e.g., ecological region or watershed). The generation  of these metrics can be a complex, lengthy undertaking, requiringsubstantial GIS expertise. The U.S. EPA  Landscape Ecology Branch has developed a user-friendly interface to facilitate this process. It is an easy to  use ArcView extension that calculates many commonly used landscape metrics. By providing an intuitive  interface, the extension provides the ability to generate landscape metrics to a wide audience, regardless of  their GIS knowledge level. ATtILA is a robust, flexible program. It accepts data from a broad range of  sources and is equally suitable across all landscapes, from deserts to rain forests to urban areas. Four  families of metrics are included in the extension: landscape characteristics, riparian characteristics, human  stressors, and physical characteristics. Each group has a dialog to accept user input on which metrics to  calculate and what input data to use. ATtILA is available as a beta test version at the present time.   ",  ,,  Donald W.

BASINS was developed by the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Office of Water to address three objectives: (1) To facilitate  examination of environmental information, (2) To support analysis of environmental systems, and (3) To  provide a framework for examining management alternatives. BASINS provides both simple (e.g. PLOAD)  and temporally detailed (e.g. HSPF, SWAT, SWMM) models for simulating hydrologic and pollutant  loads/concentrations emanating from watersheds. BASINS also provides direct linkages between  watershed and detailed aquatic ecosystem simulation models (AQUATOX, WASP), to facilitate analysis of  watershed impacts on aquatic ecosystem processes.

It is designed to be  flexible. It can support analysis at a variety of scales using tools that range from simple to sophisticated.  BASINS was also conceived as a system for supporting the development of TMDLs. Section 303(d) of the  Clean Water Act requires states to develop TMDLs for water bodies that are not meeting applicable water  quality standards by using technology-based controls. Developing TMDLs requires a watershed-based  approach that integrates both point and non-point sources. BASINS supports this type of watershed-based  point and non-point source analysis for a variety of pollutants. The user can also test different management  options.   Traditional approaches to watershed-based assessments typically involve many separate steps preparing  data, summarizing information, developing maps and tables, and applying and interpreting models. Each  step is performed using a variety of tools and computer systems. The isolated implementation of steps can  result in a lack of integration, limited coordination, and time-intensive execution. BASINS makes  watershed and water quality studies easier by bringing key data and analytical components ""under one  roof."" Using the familiar Windows environment, analysts can efficiently access national environmental  information, apply assessment and planning tools, and run a variety of proven, robust non-point loading  and water quality models. With many of the necessary components together in one system, the analysis  time is significantly reduced, a greater variety of questions can be answered, and data and management  needs can be more efficiently identified. BASINS takes advantage of recent developments in software, data  management technologies, and computer capabilities to provide the user with a fully comprehensive  watershed management tool.   ","  The model uses mixed U.S. and S.I. units or flexible (user-defined) units. The model provides  mathematical guidance to assist the user when selecting modeling parameters.

Governing equations are solved numerically and analytically, with solutions available in closed form.    ","  There was extensive beta testing (model evaluation) during system development.  Sensitivity analysis has been performed on HSPF in online calibration guidance.  The model has been externally peer reviewed.

 BASS  , 11/16/2009   ,, Bioaccumulation and Aquatic System Simulator  ,"  BASS (Bioaccumulation and Aquatic )System Simulator) is a Fortran 95 simulation program that predicts  the population and bioaccumulation dynamics of age-structured fish assemblages that are exposed to  hydrophobic organic pollutants and class B and borderline metals that complex with sulfhydryl groups  (e.g., cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc). The model's bioaccumulation algorithms  are based on diffusion kinetics and are coupled to a process-based model for the growth of individual fish.  These algorithms consider both biological attributes of fishes and physico-chemical properties of the  chemicals that determine diffusive exchange across gill membranes and intestinal mucosa. Biological  characteristics used by the model include the fish's gill morphometry, feeding and growth rate, and  proximate composition (i.e., its fractional aqueous, lipid, and structural organic content). Relevant  physico-chemical properties are the chemical's aqueous diffusivity, n-octanol / water partition coefficient  (Kow), and, for metals, binding coefficients to proteins and other organic matter. BASS simulates the  growth of individual fish using a standard mass balance, bioenergetic model (i.e., growth = ingestion egestion  - respiration - specific dynamic action - excretion). A fish's realized ingestion is calculated from  its maximum consumption rate adjusted for the availability of prey of the appropriate size and taxonomy.  The community's food web is delineated by defining one or more foraging classes for each fish species  based on its body weight, body length, or age. The dietary composition of each of these foraging classes is  specified as a combination of benthos, incidental terrestrial insects, periphyton / attached algae,  phytoplankton, zooplankton, and one or more fish species. Population dynamics are generated by predatory  mortalities defined by community's food web and standing stocks, physiological mortality rates, the  maximum longevity of species, toxicological responses to chemical exposures, and dispersal.

 BATHTUB  , 12/03/2009  ,, BATHTUB. ,"  The BATHTUB model is designed to facilitate application of empirical eutrophication models to  morphometrically complex reservoirs. The program performs water and nutrient balance calculations in a  steady-state, spatially segmented hydraulic network that accounts for advective transport, diffusive  transport, and nutrient sedimentation. Eutrophication-related water quality conditions (expressed in terms  of total phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, transparency, organic nitrogen, nonortho-phosphorus, and  hypolimnetic oxygen depletion rate) are predicted using empirical relationships previously developed and  tested for reservoir applications.   To reflect data limitations or other sources of uncertainty, key inputs to the model can be specified in  probabilistic terms (mean and CV). Outputs are expressed in terms of a mean value and CV for each mass  balance term and response variable. Output CVs are based upon a first-order error analysis which accounts  for input variable uncertainty and inherent model error.   The model is available in both DOS and Win32 versions.

 BEN   , 07/11/2011   ,, Calculating the Economic Savings from  Noncompliance   ,"  Since its development in 1984, EPA staff have used the BEN computer model extensively in the process of  developing penalty figures for settlement purposes that reflect the economic benefit a violator has derived  from delaying and/or avoiding compliance with environmental regulations. Calculating a violator's  economic benefit using the BEN computer model is usually the first step in developing a civil penalty  figure under the Agency's Policy on Civil Penalties (PT.1-1) February 16, 1984, and A Framework for  Statute-Specific Approaches to Penalty Assessments (PT.1-2) February 16, 1984. The Agency developed  the BEN computer model to assist in fulfilling one of the main goals of the Policy on Civil Penalties:  recovery, at a minimum, of the economic benefit from noncompliance. Users of the model do not need any  background in economics, financial analysis, or computers. Because the program contains standard values  for many of the variables needed to calculate the economic benefit, BEN can be run with only a small  number of user-provided inputs (mainly compliance costs, the noncompliance date, the compliance date  and the estimated date the penalty will be paid). The program also allows the user to replace those standard  values with user-specific information.

Then the user must supply some key dates: when the violation started,  the expected compliance date and the expected penalty payment date. Then the user must supply  compliance cost figures.

",,"  The cornerstone of EPA’s penalty assessment program for the last 24 years has been that any civil penalty  should always seek to recapture a violator’s economic gain from violating the law. The problem is that  since the vast majority of our enforcement personnel do not have any finance on accounting knowledge, we  need some simple approach that will allow them to quickly calculate what those savings are. The BEN  model requires some minimal data regarding the date of noncompliance, the date of compliance, the date of  penalty payment along with the cost of compliance. Then it uses that data to generate a reasonably accurate  calculation the economic savings. The more challenging data (violator’s cost of money, the tax rates and    inflations rates) are provided by the model by way of default parameters which can easily be replaced with  violator specific information if the violator so requests.   ","  The model first determines what it would have cost the violator to have complied on time, and then it  compares it with the actual compliance costs incurred (or to be incurred) by the violator and discounts those  costs back to the date compliance should have been achieved. BEN then compares those two figures,  subtracts the delay compliance scenario costs from the costs of the on time case to determine economic  savings as of the date noncompliance started. It then compounds that amount forward to penalty payment  date at the violator’s discount/compound rate to yield the actual economic savings.   ","  The model has been externally peer reviewed. The model developer, a contractor, is currently responsible  for all QA/QC activity. A previous version of the model was peer reviewed twice (1988 and 1991) by  leading academicians in the field of corporate finance. Contractor verified that calculations were similar to  those an independent financial analyst might perform.   ","  The model evaluates the economic savings from delaying and avoiding pollution control costs. In these  situations, all the firm’s profits were legally available if it would have complied with the law. But there are  another group of benefits that occur when there is no way to achieve them except by violating the law.  These used to be called benefit from illegal competitive advantage (ICA). But they are now referred to as  Beyond BEN Benefit (BBB). There are four basic scenarios where this can happen: 1) violator produces an  illegal product (e.g. DDT); or provides an illegal service (e.g. cut off catalytic converters from cars); 2)  violator produces illegal output or throughput (e.g. operating the plant longer than the permit allows); 3)  violator grabs an illegal market share (e.g. violator takes all the hazardous waste it is supposed to treat and  instead dumps the barrels into a local river. Instead of keeping the extra money, it passes along all the  savings to its customers and increases its share of the hazardous waste treatment business in its state from  10% to 25%); and 4) violator avoids the regulatory system in order to start operating sooner than legally  possible (firm and its two competitors file for permits to lay cable to an island off the US mainland. While  the government is reviewing the applications, the violator goes ahead and lays the cable. So when the  permits finally get issues 6 months later, the violator has already layed the cable and signed up all the  customers.).

The two-dimensional  transport equation is solved for each solute species and a biodegradation reaction term is included. The flow  and transport equations are discretized using a rectangular, uniformly spaced, block-centered,  finite-difference grid. Implicit finite-difference equations are used to solve the flow equation. The average  linear flow velocities are then calculated and used to solve the transport equation using the method of  characteristics and particle tracking.   ","  Macroscopic fluid substrate, electron acceptor, and cellular nutrient concentrations are used to calculate  uptake and growth. Monod kinetics is used to represent biodegradation uptake that depends on a single  solute concentration. For biodegradation processes that involve several solutes, two alternate modified  Monod formulations are included in BIOMOC. The multiple Monod formulation assumes that the  biodegradation reaction is limited by the concentration of each solute involved in the reaction. The  alternative minimum Monod formulation assumes that a single solute is limiting the process. In addition,  the Monod parameters can be specified to approximate zero-order or first-order biodegradation rates.   All degradation kinetics formulations include competitive, noncompetitive, and Haldane inhibition.  Competitive inhibition isused to represent the inhibition of uptake of a secondary substrate when the  primary substrate is still present. The noncompetitive inhibition formulation is useful for modeling the  transition between redox zones within contaminant plumes; an example of noncompetitive inhibition is the  inhibition of an anaerobic biodegradation process by the presence of oxygen. Haldane inhibition is used to  model toxicity. The biomass growth rate is proportional to the degradation rate. However, growth may be    either turned off or limited by a biomass inhibition formulation.   BIOMOC does not include pore-scale processes and does not account for the effect of diffusion into and  out of the biophase. It has also been assumed in BIOMOC that the biomass remains attached to the  sediments. Pore clogging by biomass growth is not accounted for.

The transport simulation in Bioplume III is based on the  USGS solute transport code MOC. The program solves the solute transport equation six times to determine  the fate and transport of the hydrocarbons and electron acceptors (oxygen, nitrate, ferric iron, sulfate, and  carbon dioxide). Three different kinetic expressions can be used to simulate the aerobic and anaerobic  biodegradation reactions. These include: first-order decay, instantaneous reaction and Monod kinetics. The  principle of superposition is used to combine the hydrocarbon plume with the electron acceptor plumes.   The program provides a graphical user interface that allows the user to easily create, enter, and edit data for  the Bioplume III simulation. The program requires discretization of the model domain in space and time.  The model grid has a maximum size of 35 by 35 cells and can be run for up to 99 years.

", , , ,," Type of Model:    CALPUFF is a non-steady-state time- and space-dependent Gaussian puff model. CALPUFF  includes parameterized gas phase chemical transformation of SO2, SO4=, NO, NO2, HNO3, NO3-,  and organic aerosols. CALPUFF can treat primary pollutants such as PM-10, toxic pollutants,  ammonia, and other passive pollutants. The model includes a resistance-based dry deposition model  for both gaseous pollutants and particulate matter. Wet deposition is treated using a scavenging  coefficient approach. The model has detailed parameterizations of complex terrain effects, including  terrain impingement, side-wall scrapping, and steep-walled terrain influences on lateral plume  growth. A subgrid-scale complex terrain module based on a dividing streamline concept divides the  flow into a lift component traveling over the obstacle and a wrap component deflected around the  obstacle.  The meteorological fields used by CALPUFF are produced by the CALMET meteorological model.  CALMET includes a diagnostic wind field model containing objective analysis and parameterized  treatments of slope flows, valley flows, terrain blocking effects, and kinematic terrain effects, lake  and sea breeze circulations, and a divergence minimization procedure. An energy-balance scheme is  used to compute sensible and latent heat fluxes and turbulence parameters over land surfaces. A  profile method is used over water. CALMET contains interfaces to prognostic meteorological models  such as the Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (e.g., MM5; Section 13.0, ref. 94), as well as the  RAMS and Eta models.  Pollutant Types:   CALPUFF may be used to model gaseous pollutants or particulate matter that are inert or undergo linear  chemical reactions, such as SO2, SO4=, NO, NO2, HNO3, NO3-, NH3, PM-10, and toxic pollutants. For  regional haze analyses, sulfate and nitrate particulate components are explicitly treated.   see more below   ","  Source-Receptor Relationships:   CALPUFF contains no fundamental limitations on the number of sources or receptors. Parameter files are  provided that allow the user to specify the maximum number of sources, receptors, puffs, species, grid  cells, vertical layers, and other model parameters. Its algorithms are designed to be suitable for  source-receptor distances from tens of meters to hundreds of kilometers.   Recommendations for Regulatory Use:    CALPUFF is appropriate for long range transport (source-receptor distances of 50 to several hundred  kilometers) of emissions from point, volume, area, and line sources. The meteorological input data  should be fully characterized with time-and-space-varying three dimensional wind and  meteorological conditions using CALMET, as discussed in paragraphs 9.3(c) and 9.3.1.2(d) of  Appendix W.  CALPUFF may also be used on a case-by-case basis if it can be demonstrated using the criteria in  Section 3.2 that the model is more appropriate for the specific application. The purpose of choosing a  modeling system like CALPUFF is to fully treat stagnation, wind reversals, and time and space  variations of meteorology effects on transport and dispersion, as discussed in paragraph 8.2.8(a).  For regulatory applications of CALMET and CALPUFF, the regulatory default option should be  used. Inevitably, some of the model control options will have to be set specific for the application  used. Inevitably, some of the model control options will have to be set specific for the application   using expert judgement and in consultation with the relevant reviewing authorities.   Plume Behavior:   Momentum and buoyant plume rise is treated according to the plume rise equations of Briggs (1974,   1975) for non-downwashing point sources, Schulman and Scire (1980) for line sources and point   sources subject to building downwash effects, and Zhang (1993) for buoyant area sources.

Completely dependent on the size of the modeling application   ,"  Linux, SGI, Sun, HP, IBM, DEC/Alpha   ",  Fortran compiler   ,,  www.camx.com    ,,"  CAMx requires inputs to describe photochemical conditions, surface characteristics, initial/boundary  conditions, emission rates, and various meteorological fields over the entire modeling domain. Table 3-1 in  the User's Guide summarizes the input data requirements of CAMx. Preparing this information requires  several preprocessing/premodeling steps to translate ""raw"" emissions, meteorological, air quality and other  data into final input files for CAMx. We expect that most CAMx applications will utilize output from a  prognostic meteorological model that can generate all of the required time varying three-dimensional  meteorological fields. Most CAMx I/O file formats are compatible with those of the UAM genre, which  allows the user to employ widely available software designed specifically for these formats to develop the  input files or to postprocess and visualize the output files. This also allows CAMx to be run with historical  UAM-V databases.   Gridded emissions, point source emissions, gridded meteorology, gridded landuse, photolysis rates, and  other optional inputs   ","  CAMx produces gridded hourly (or some other user specified time interval) average concentration output  files containing either surface layer fields or entire three-dimensional fields of user-selected species. An  average output file is written for the master grid, and a separate file is written containing all fine grid nests  together. Files with structures identical to surface layer concentration fields, and for the same user-selected  species, are also written for gridded deposition parameters. Gridded instantaneous fields of all species are  assumed to be used for restarts only, and so only the last two hours of the simulation are written to these  files. Commonly available graphical output visualization and animation software can be applied for  visualization of CAMx output files. The CAMx Probing Tool options provide their own information in  separate output files that can be viewed directly or further postprocessed for detailed analysis.

It is designed to unify all of the technical features  required of ""state-of-the-science"" air quality models into a single system that is computationally efficient,  easy to use, and publicly available. The model code has a highly modular and well-documented structure  which eases the insertion of new or alternate algorithms and features. The input/output file formats are  based on the Urban Airshed Model and are compatible with many existing pre- and post-processing tools.   CAMx can perform simulations on three types of cartesian map projections: Universal Transverse  Mercator, Rotated Polar Stereographic, and Lambert Conic Conformal. CAMx also offers the option of  operating on a curvi-linear geodetic latitude/longitude grid system as well. Furthermore, the vertical grid  structure is defined externally, so layer interface heights may be specified as any arbitrary function of  space and/or time. This flexibility in defining the horizontal and vertical grid structures allows CAMx to be  configured to match the grid of any meteorological model that is used to provide environmental input  fields.   ","  CAMx incorporates all of the technical attributes demanded of state-of-the-art photochemical grid models,  including two-way grid nesting, a subgrid-scale Plume-in-Grid module to treat the early dispersion and  chemistry of point source NOx plumes, and a fast chemistry solver.   In addition to these, CAMx provides a number of advanced and unique features, including:  Particulate Matter (PM) Modeling:   CAMx Mechanism 4 (M4) provides ""1-atmosphere"" modeling for fine and coarse PM and ozone.  Aqueous phase chemistry is modeled using the RADM mechanism. Inorganic  sulfate/nitrate/ammonium chemistry is modeled with ISORROPIA. Secondary organic aerosols are  modeled using a semi-volatile scheme called SOAP. Wet and dry deposition processes are included  for gasses and particles. Gridded deposition information is output along with the concentrations.    Ozone Source Apportionment Technology (OSAT):  OSAT and its derivative apportionment algorithms (e.g., APCA) allow CAMx to track source  contributions to predicted grid cell ozone concentrations within a single model run. Thus the model  provides a clear picture of the likely distribution of ozone and precursors by source, as well as an  indication of NOx- or VOC-limited chemistry. This feature revolutionizes the interpretation and  understanding of photochemical model results and leads to better design of control strategies.    Direct Decoupled Method (DDM) for sensitivity analysis:  See User’s Manual at www.camx.com    ","  DECOUPLED DIRECT METHOD FOR SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS   Photochemical modelers have traditionally used sensitivity analysis both for model performance evaluation  and emission control strategy design. The simplest approach to sensitivity analysis, often referred to as the  ""brute-force"" approach, involves changing a model input parameter, rerunning the model, and then  evaluating the change in model output. The change in output is quantified from the difference between the  sensitivity case and base case. This approach requires a separate simulation for each parameter  investigated. For example, a model performance evaluation may use sensitivity simulations to evaluate the  impact of changing the initial conditions (ICs), boundary conditions (BCs), biogenic emissions,  anthropogenic emissions, etc. Sensitivity analysis is also used to aid control strategy design. For example,  across-the-board VOC and NOx emission reductions are used to determine whether VOC and/or NOx  reduction strategies are the most effective path to reduce ozone.   The advantages of the ""brute force"" method for sensitivity analysis are:  Applicable to any model input parameter;    Results are conceptually easy to explain and interpret.  The limitations of the ""brute force"" method are:    Computationally inefficient;  Sensitivity depends upon the magnitude of the perturbation if the model response is non-linear;  Sensitivity derived from small perturbations may contain significant levels of uncertainty (numerical  noise).

","  CAP88-PC uses a Visual Basic user interface to gather information specific to the assessment, such as the  release height, isotopic activity release rates for up to 6 sources, and regional food usage. Previously  generated input data concerning meteorological conditions and the population distribution in the  assessment area is contained in external files.

","  The CAP88-PC programs represent one of the best available validated codes for the purpose of making  comprehensive dose and risk assessments. The Gaussian plume model used in CAP88-PC to estimate  dispersion of radionuclides in air is one of the most commonly used models in Government guidebooks. It  produces results that agree with experimental data as well as any model, is fairly easy to work with, and is  consistent with the random nature of turbulence. Version 3 has not modified the basic Gaussian plume  algorithm used by the AIRDOS module of CAP88-PC, and comparison cases between version 2 and 3  have shown no significant changes in the dispersion calculations.   EPA’s Office of Radiation and Indoor Air has made comparisons between the predictions of  annual-average ground-level concentration to actual environmental measurements, and found very good  agreement. In the paper ""Comparison of AIRDOS-EPA Prediction of Ground-Level Airborne  Radionuclide Concentrations to Measured Values"" (Be86), environmental monitoring data at five  Department of Energy (DOE) sites were compared to AIRDOS-EPA predictions. EPA concluded that as  often as not, AIRDOS-EPA predictions are within a factor of 2 of actual concentrations.   ","  While up to six stack or area sources can be modeled, all the sources are modeled as if located at the same  point; that is, stacks cannot be located in different areas of a facility. The same plume rise mechanism  (buoyant or momentum) is used for each source. Also, area sources are treated as uniform. Variation in  radionuclide concentrations due to complex terrain cannot be modeled.   Errors arising from these assumptions will have a negligible effect for assessments where the distance to  exposed individuals is large compared to the stack height, area or facility size.   Dose and risk estimates from CAP88-PC are applicable only to low-level chronic exposures, since the  health effects and dosimetric data are based on low-level chronic intakes. CAP88-PC cannot be used for  either short-term or high-level radionuclide intakes.

 CARBDOSE  , 12/17/2009   ,, CARBDOSE (FOR WINDOWS).  ,"  The CARBDOSE program was again revised in 2001 because major changes had occurred in computer  operating systems. DOS character based programs like CARBDOSE 4.0 were increasingly difficult to run  under modern 32 bit operating systems. The CARBDOSE 5.0 program uses the revisions of 1999 reflecting  major changes occurring in calculating radon health effects. EPA/NAS presently believes that the ingestion  risk for radon in water is 4 times less than thought in 1993. The CARBDOSE program reports risks via  inhalation and ingestion separately as risks of cancer per 10,000 population. CARBDOSE was written to  provide a way for people, with or without a strong technical background in health physics, to make  important radiation health calculations related to the removal of radon from water by granular activated  carbon (GAC).   CARBDOSE version 5.0 is being released in conjunction with the establishment of a public water supply  MCL and AMCL for radon. While the establishment of final PWS radon maximum contaminant levels has  not yet been made, it seems advisable to go ahead with dissemination of public health risk information to  facilitate the planning process. Health effect data in the program, including smoking history, are based on  domestic point of entry volumes and are, with the exception of gamma data, independent of the removal  method. CARBDOSE provides health effect information applicable to radon removal by domestic aeration  units or the larger packed tower aeration systems favored for public water supplies.

 CE-QUAL-W2  , 08/31/2009   ,, CE-QUAL-W2  ,"  CE-QUAL-W2 is a two-dimensional (longitudinal/vertical) hydrodynamic and water quality model that has  been under development for over 25 years and has been successfully applied to over 400 systems  throughout the U.S. and the world. It is the reservoir model of choice for TVA, USGS, USBR, USEPA, and  USACE. Version 3 can now model entire waterbasins including sloping rivers, reservoirs, and estuaries.   Relevant hydrodynamic/transport capabilities include dynamic adjustment of the timestep to help ensure  numerical stability, variable vertical/longitudinal grid spacing, wetting/drying, multiple point/nonpoint  sources, and a higher-order numerical transport scheme (QUICKEST/ ULTIMATE) that reduces numerical  diffusion and eliminates physically unrealistic over / undershoots.   Relevant water quality capabilities include any number of generic consitutuents that could include a  conservative tracer, and/or water age, and/or coliform bacteria groups. These generic constituents are  defined by a settling velocity, and/or a 0-order decay rate, and/or a 1st order decay rate, and/or an  Arhennius temperature rate multiplier. The model can also simulate any number of phytoplankton groups,  any number of CBOD groups, any number of inorganic suspended solids groups, phosphate, ammonium,  nitrate/nitrite, dissolved silica, particulate biogenic silica, dissolved iron, dissolved oxygen, total inorganic  carbon, and alkalinity.

 CHEMSTEER  , 07/11/2011   ,, CHEMSTEER  ,"  INTRODUCTION: The Chemical Screening Tool for Exposures and Environmental Releases  (ChemSTEER) is a personal computer-based software program that uses the U. S. Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics' most current screening-level  workplace exposure and release assessment methods. ChemSTEER generates screening-level estimates of  environmental releases of and worker exposures to a chemical manufactured and used in industrial and  commercial operations and workplaces. The tool also contains data and estimation methods to assess  situations involving common industrial / commercial sectors (e.g., automotive refinishing) and chemical  functional uses (e.g., surfactant in hard surface cleaner - this use not included in current draft).  ChemSTEER does not contain methods for estimating exposures to chemicals to the general public, to  consumers, or to other species in the environment.   ChemSTEER was developed for technically-knowledgeable users to support the EPA in assessing the  potential exposures and risks to chemicals. A primary application is for assessing new chemicals that are  submitted to EPA under Section 5 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Estimates from  screening-level exposure models are rarely, if at all, used as the sole justification for regulatory decision  making at EPA. When available, additional information, data, and more rigorous tools are used to improve  the estimates of exposures and risks for such decisions. Another primary application is for assessing  existing chemicals, such as those chemicals covered under the High Production Volume (HPV) Program,  for which monitoring data are insufficient or unavailable. However, the use of ChemSTEER is not intended  as a substitute for the collection and reporting of monitoring data for exposures and releases.   The methods and models in ChemSTEER have undergone internal EPA review and most have been used  extensively in EPA assessments for over 10 years. EPA is in the process of pursuing external peer review  for these methods and models.   PREREQUISITES: The user must have a good understanding of the workplaces to be assessed (except for  some specific industries programmed as ""industry-specific operations"" in ChemSTEER) and have some  key chemical- and operation- specific data (e.g., vapor pressure, molecular weight, water solubility,  throughput volumes, concentrations). The user must have a good working knowledge of ChemSTEER and  its methods to generate credible assessment results.   BRIEF ON LOGIC AND LAYOUT: The current beta version was developed primarily to meet the  objective of producing internal EPA reports on workplace releases and exposures. The logic and layout of  the program were developed to achieve this objective.

 CMAQ   , 11/16/2009   ,, Community Multiscale Air Quality Model   ,"  The U.S. EPA developed the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) system to apply a “one  atmosphere” multiscale and multi-pollutant modeling approach based mainly on the “first principles”  description of the atmosphere. The multiscale capability is supported by the governing diffusion equation in  a generalized coordinate system that handles many map projections and vertical coordinate systems, a  scheme that maintains dynamic consistency with the upstream (i.e., off-line) meteorology model, and a  nesting approach. The multi-pollutant (i.e., tropospheric ozone, acid deposition, particulates, air toxics,  mercury, nitrogen loading, and visibility) capability is provided by the generalized chemistry mechanism  description, general numerical solver, and comprehensive description of gaseous and aqueous chemistry  and modal aerosol dynamics. Input emission data sets for CMAQ are estimated using the SMOKE  emissions modeling and processing system. Typical retrospective model applications have employed as  input three-dimensional descriptions of prevalent meteorological conditions simulated by the MM5 and  Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) meteorological models, while air quality forecast applications  have linked the CMAQ model with the National Weather Service’s operational North American Mesoscale  (NAM) model.

",,"  Scientifically credible models that synthesize our current understanding of the atmospheric physical and  chemical processes that regulate the fate of a variety of primary and secondary air pollutants are needed to  assist in formulation of air quality management plans and environmental policy decisions. CMAQ is a  comprehensive atmospheric chemistry-transport model that simulates the spatial distributions of a variety of  atmospheric pollutants (ozone and other photooxidants, acidic species, mercury, air toxics, and  size-distributed and chemically-speciated fine particulate matter) from local to hemispheric spatial scales  over hourly to annual temporal scales. The model also estimates atmospheric deposition of a variety of  airborne species as well as visibility impairment associated with particulate matter air pollution.  Applications of the model have guided formulation of air quality management plans as well as in providing  short-term forecast guidance on air quality conditions.   ","  The CMAQ modeling system has been designed to approach air quality as a whole by including  state-of-the-science capabilities for modeling multiple air quality issues, including tropospheric ozone, fine  particles, acid deposition, and visibility degradation. In this way, the development of CMAQ involves the  scientific expertise from each of these areas and combines the capabilities to enable a community modeling  practice. CMAQ was also designed to have multi-scale capabilities so that separate models were not needed  for urban and regional scale air quality modeling.   The target grid resolutions and domain sizes for CMAQ range spatially and temporally over several orders  of magnitude. With the temporal flexibility of the model, simulations can be performed to evaluate longer  term pollutant climatologies as well as short term transport from localized sources. With the model's ability  to handle a large range of spatial scales, CMAQ can be used for urban and regional scale model  simulations. By making CMAQ a modeling system that addresses multiple pollutants and different spatial  scales, CMAQ has a ""one atmosphere"" perspective that combines the efforts of the scientific community.  Improvements will be made to the CMAQ modeling system as the scientific community further develops  the state-of-the-science.   ","  CMAQ model evaluations have been conducted for a variety of time periods and pollutant species. The  model is continuously being evaluated using data from operational routine monitoring networks for ozone  and fine particulate matter in the U.S. Diagnostic evaluations are conducted using surface and aloft  observed data from intensive field studies, such as the 2006 Texas Air Quality Study, 2004 ICARTT study,  the Southern Oxidants Study and the Supersites intensives. Additional details on model evaluation activities  can be found at: http://www.epa.gov/asmdnerl/ModelEvaluation/index.html   The CMAQ user community also performs detailed evaluation and verification against observations as well  as sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. The results from these are presented at the annual CMAS meeting;  presentation and extended abstracts can be found at: http://www.cmascenter.org/conference.cfm   Also see: Special issue on Model Evaluation: Evaluation of Urban and Regional Eulerian Air Quality  Models, Atmospheric Environment, Volume 40, Issue 26, August 2006.   ","  CMAQ is a deterministic model. Thus, some discrepancies in comparing grid-average values with point  measurements should be expected.   Majority of the current regional application involve 12 km horizontal resolution grids while urban scale  applications typically use 1-4 km resolutions. Finer scale applications would require enhancements in the  representation of turbulent transport in the model.   The accuracy of CMAQ predictions is also intricately linked to the accuracy and resolution of the input  meteorological and emission data sets.

Nguyen   ", , , ,," HOW THE MODEL WORKS:    The CMB model is derived from physical principles with assumptions stated in Appendix A. Therefore,  the CMB is not purely a statistical model, though the least-squares estimation method used to solve the  CMB equations bears resemblance to multiple linear regression analysis. The CMB consists of the  following set of equations:   Ci = Fi1S1 + Fi2S2 +. .+ FijSj . .+ FiJSJ, i=1..I, j=1..J   where:   Ci = Concentration of species i measured at a receptor site  Fij = Fraction of species i in emissions from source j  Sj = Estimate of the contribution of source j  I = Number of chemical species  J = Number of source types   These equations have a unique solution only when the number of species is equal to or greater than the  number of sources. Model evaluation studies show that the greater the number of species, the more precise  the apportionment. These simultaneous equations are solved by an effective variance weighted least  squares estimation method (Watson et al., 1984) which has been thoroughly tested and documented. This  method also requires precision estimates for the Ci and Fij values as model input. These precision estimates  result in realistic uncertainties associated with the source contribution estimates, Sj, which are calculated by  the model. All source contribution estimates must be accompanied by their calculated standard errors when  CMB modeling results are reported.   "," WHAT THE MODEL DOES:   The CMB model uses the chemical composition of ambient pollution samples to estimate the contributions  of different source types to the measured pollutant concentrations. The CMB model has been most widely  used for suspended particulate matter, but it is equally applicable to gaseous species. The chemical  composition of each source-type's emissions (source profile) must also be known to use the model.   The CMB model quantifies contributions from chemically distinct source-types rather than contributions  from individual emitters. For example, the model might calculate that 6.7 +/- 2.2 ug/m3 of PM10 are  contributed by residual oil combustion, but this contribution might not be further resolved into  concentrations attributable to Power Plant 2, Industrial Boiler 3, Hospital Heating Plant 6, etc.    Sources which have similar chemical compositions cannot be separated by the model. The software  performs tests on ambient data and source profiles which tell how well source-type contributions can be  resolved from each other. The CMB7 software can be applied to measurements of up to four different  particle size fractions when source and ambient data are available.   See More Information in ""Case Studies""   Key Limitations to Model Scope   When modeling PM10, the fine (PM2.5, 0 to 2.5 um aerodynamic diameter) and coarse (2.5 to 10 um  aerodynamic diameter) size fractions are often modeled separately. This feature allows particle size as well  as chemical characteristics to be used in distinguishing one source type from another. The CMB model  calculates source contribution estimates for each individual ambient sample, which is usually of 24-hour  duration for PM10.   The chemical profiles may differ from one sample to the next owing to differences in emission rates (e.g.,  some days may have woodstove burning bans in effect and others will not), wind directions (e.g., a  downwind point source would not be expected to be contributing at an upwind sampling site), and changes  in emissions compositions (e.g., different gasoline characteristics and engine performance in winter and  summer may result in different profiles).   For PM10 assessment, 24-hour samples are taken every sixth day for a one-year period, and every sample  is apportioned separately. Seasonal and annual averages of source contribution estimates are calculated to  evaluate the annual PM10 standard.   The CMB model is normally used to apportion particulate matter which is directly emitted. The remaining  sulfate, nitrate, and organic compounds which are not attributed to primary emissions are secondary species  and are not attributed directly to sources.   Research is currently underway to calculate or measure fractionated source profiles which simulate the  profile as it would look at the receptor after aging, transformation, deposition, and transport. When this  research is completed, the CMB model may be applicable to the attribution of secondary as well as primary  species.

 CMB8  , 11/16/2009   ,, Chemical Mass Balance 8   ,"  The Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) air quality model is one of several receptor models that have been  applied to air resources management. Receptor models use the chemical and physical characteristics of  gases and particles measured at source and receptor to both identify the presence of and to quantify source  contributions to receptor concentrations. Receptor models are generally contrasted with dispersion models  that use pollutant emissions rate estimates, meteorological transport, and chemical transformation  mechanisms to estimate the contribution of each source to receptor concentrations. The two types of  models are complementary, with each type having strengths that compensate for the weaknesses of the  other.   Chemical Mass Balance 8 is an interim step to update CMB7. Cmb8 has features that represent  enhancements over CMB7. It is suggested that one consider using CMB8 for source apportionments that  are suitable for CMB capabilities.

The manual describes how to operate CMB Version 8 (CMB8) modeling software to calculate source  contributions to ambient PM10 (particles with aerodynamic diameters nominally less than 10 um), PM2.5  (particles with aerodynamic diameters nominally less than 2.5 um), and volatile organic compounds  (VOC).   The applications and validation protocol describes how to apply CMB8 to specific situations and how to  evaluate its outputs. Several review articles, books, and conference proceedings provide additional  information about the CMB and other receptor models (Chow et al., 1993; Gordon, 1980, 1988; Hopke and   Dattner, 1982 ; Hopke, 1985, 1991; Pace, 1986, 1991; Stevens and Pace, 1984; Watson, 1979, 1984;  Watson et al., 1989, 1990, 1991).

For each run of CMB, the model fits speciated data from a single source or group of sources to a particular  receptor (sample). The source profile abundances (i.e., the mass fraction of a chemical or other property in  the emissions from each source type) and the receptor concentrations, with appropriate uncertainty  estimates, serve as input data to CMB. The output consists of the amount contributed by each source type  represented by a profile to the total mass, as well as to each chemical species.   CMB calculates values for the contributions from each source and the uncertainties of those values. CMB  is applicable to multi-species data sets, the most common of which are chemically-characterized PM10,  PM2.5, and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). The theory of CMB is described in Appendix A.   ","  CMB is intended to complement rather than replace other data analysis and modeling meth ods. CMB  helps explain observations that have been made; it does not predict ambient impacts from sources as do  dispersion models.   When source contributions are proportional to emissions, as they often are for PM and VOC, then a  source-specific proportional rollback (Barth, 1970; Cass and McCrae, 1981; Chang and Weinstock, 1975;  deNevers and Morris, 1975) is used to estimate the effects of emissions reductions. Similarly, when a  secondary compound apportioned by CMB is known to be limited by a certain precursor, a proportional  rollback is used on the controlling precursor.   Key Limitations to Model Scope   CMB model assumptions are:    Compositions of source emissions are constant over the period of ambient and source sampling;  Chemical species do not react with each other (i.e., they add linearly);  All sources with a potential for contributing to the receptor have been identified and have had their  emissions characterized;  The number of sources or source categories is less than or equal to the number of species;  The source profiles are linearly independent of each other; and  Measurement uncertainties are random, uncorrelated, and normally distributed.

It can used to  estimate the travel and emissions impacts of pricing and subsidy incentives, transit improvement,  carpooling and vanpooling promotion; and telecommute and work hour strategies.   It is designed to be usable by people with basic computer skills who do not necessarily have experience  with models. Commuter offers two levels of analysis: Regional analyses can be done on programs covering  an urban area, a central business district or a highly-traveled corridor. Site- specific analyses enable  benefits to be projected for programs at individual worksites.   Data requirements include the number of people affected, baseline mode shares, trip lengths by mode, and  description of the program implemented, including changes in travel time or cost. Gasoline price is an  optional input. The user has the option to change default parameters affecting strategy effectiveness.

It uses artificial intelligence technology of rule-based expert  systems to validate data input, suggest parameter specification, and then classify the momentum and  buoyancy of the discharge in relation to local boundaries to select appropriate model to accurately predict  the physical processes within the mixing zone   ","  The rule-based classification system and series of sub-models in CORMIX are based on the physical  hydrodynamics of the mixing process. These physical processes include the initial jet momentum flux and  buoyancy flux, outfall geometry, boundary interactions, density current buoyant spreading, and passive  ambient diffusion.   The Technical Reports for CORMIX1, CORMIX2, and CORMIX3 contain detailed information on the  theoretical classification of different types of flows (e.g., by using length scales). Each flow classification  is modeled with by a series of sub-models, each of which simulate a different region of the flow for which a  particular physical process dominates.   CORMIX consists of a rule-based classification system linked to a series of hydrodynamic simulation  models, visualization routines, and outfall design tools. The diagram below depicts a small part of this  classification, for single port discharges into uniform ambient layers.   For more information on the CORMIX rule based system, click here.    ","   Independent CORMIX validation studies.  The Technical Reports on CORMIX1, CORMIX2, and CORMIX3 compare CORMIX modeling  results with numerous laboratory and field studies.  The integrated CorSens sensitivity analysis tools assists the user in conducting sensitivity analysis of  mixing zone behavior and regulatory compliance due to changes in ambient and discharge  conditions.  The CorVal online validation system is currently under development by EPA and MixZon will give  interactive client-based access via the web to a validation database of laboratory and field data on  plume mixing. It will give interactive plots of model predictions with the available data and give  regression statistics to validate a client's simulation on a case-by-case basis. The CorVal system also  contains tools for adding new experimental data to the validation database with a detailed QA/QC  procedures and documentation.  The integrated CorSupport support ticketing system tracks user requests for help, documents model  bugs if found, schedules known bugs for correction, and notifies the user when the bug fix is  available.

 CPM   , 09/01/2010   ,, Sea Level Rise Coastal Property Model   ,"  The impact of sea level rise on coastal properties depends critically on the human response to the threat,  which in turn depends on several factors, including the immediacy of the risk, the magnitude of property  value at risk, options for adapting to the threat and the cost of those options, and in some cases, land-use or  regulatory restrictions that apply to the property. This model estimates the response to and economic  impacts of sea level rise on coastal properties using a spatially comprehensive Geographic Information  System (GIS)-based modeling approach that considers each of the aforementioned factors. The model can  be used for a number of purposes, including the development of: 1) national-level estimates of the benefits  of reducing sea level rise through the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions; and 2) local-level results  assessing management actions that could facilitate adaptation to sea-level rise risks.

",  Not available.   ,  Moderate level of education and experience related to coastal vulnerability and protection strategies.   ,,"  A more complete understanding of the risks posed by climate change and the benefits of avoiding damages  to coastal areas requires quantification and valuation of potential impacts. This information can serve  multiple purposes. First, valuation and incorporation of potential climate change impacts on coastal  communities and ecosystems will help inform the design of climate change policy. Representation of these  impacts in policy discussions may help reduce or minimize future costs, inform decisions to balance  investments in mitigation and adaptation, and identify conditions that lead to the most dangerous and costly  impacts.   Second, land use planners responsible for protecting coastal development and natural systems will  increasingly rely on information regarding resources and decisions that are most vulnerable or sensitive to  climate change. In response to rising sea levels, coastal planners and homeowners are likely to protect their  property by elevating structures, constructing seawalls, nourishing beaches, and using other methods. Such  an investment in protecting shorelines will likely impose substantial costs on property owners, local  municipalities, and state and federal programs. Modeling tools designed to estimate the value of resources  at risk and the costs associated with protecting land from these impacts can help managers make decisions  that promote sustainability, reduce overall costs, and improve coastal resiliency. While effective adaptation  to the impacts of climate change can greatly reduce the eventual costs, it requires careful advance planning.   ","  The basic structure involves arraying relevant input data and constructing a spatial geo-database on a  150-meter grid cell frame. The analysis and aggregation modules then access the geo-database, along with  a series of user-defined input parameters, such as SLR scenario and the cost of armoring or beach  nourishment, and estimate the response to SLR. Decision-making for the response modeling can be based  either on an optimal protection algorithm, which effectively approximates benefit-cost analyses for each  grid cell and, in some cases, neighboring cells, or a user-defined mapping of planning, zoning, and/or  land-use categories to a specific response category (protect or no-protect).   ","  The Coastal Property Model has been evaluated and reviewed in several peer-reviewed publications,  including the following:   Neumann, J.E., Hudgens, D.E., Herter, J. and Martinich, J.

(2010) The economics of adaptation along  developed coastline, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change, In Press.   ","  Two assumptions are worth mentioning. First, the model only estimates inundation resulting from gradual  sea level rise and does not account for the effects from periodic storm surge. However, the omission of  storm surge damage might not be an important omission. At equilibrium, with a similar pattern of storm  risks now and in the future, it could be argued that shoreline change and therefore coastal damages will be  based on property elevation relative to sea level, and the value of property, which are the two critical  variables in the model. For regional and national-scale analyses, therefore, a good first approximation of the  marginal damage of SLR is simply the property lost to the sea, or the cost of measures taken to avoid  permanent property loss.   Second, the model assumes a uniform armoring response, whereby communities will respond to rising sea  levels in optimal ways to reduce protection costs. In reality, this may not always be the case; therefore, the  model likely underestimates protection costs.

Pollutant Types:   CTDMPLUS may be used to model non-reactive, primary pollutants.   Source-Receptor Relationship:   Up to 40 point sources, 400 receptors and 25 hills may be used. Receptors and sources are allowed at any  location. Hill slopes are assumed not to exceed 15 degrees, so that the linearized equation of motion for  Boussinesq flow are applicable. Receptors upwind of the impingement point, or those associated with any  of the hills in the modeling domain, require separate treatment.   Recommendation for Regulatory Use:   CTDMPLUS is appropriate for the following applications:    Elevated point sources;  Terrain elevations above stack top; - Rural or urban areas;  Transport distances less than 50 kilometers; and  One hour to annual averaging times when used with a post-processor program such as CHAVG.  "," Plume Behavior:    As in CTDM, the basic plume rise algorithms are based on Briggs' (1975) recommendations.  A central feature of CTDMPLUS for neutral/stable conditions is its use of a critical  dividing-streamline height (Hc) to separate the flow in the vicinity of a hill into two separate layers.  The plume component in the upper layer has sufficient kinetic energy to pass over the top of the hill  while streamlines in the lower portion are constrained to flow in a horizontal plane around the hill.  Two separate components of CTDMPLUS compute ground-level concentrations resulting from  plume material in each of these flows.  The model calculates on an hourly (or appropriate steady averaging period) basis how the plume  trajectory (and, in stable/neutral conditions, the shape) is deformed by each hill. Hourly profiles of  wind and temperature measurements are used by CTDMPLUS to compute plume rise, plume  penetration (a formulation is included to handle penetration into elevated stable layers, based on  Briggs (1984)), convective scaling parameters, the value of Hc, and the Froude number above Hc.  Horizontal Winds:   CTDMPLUS does not simulate calm meteorological conditions. Both scalar and vector wind speed  observations can be read by the model. If vector wind speed is unavailable, it is calculated from the scalar  wind speed. The assignment of wind speed (either vector or scalar) at plume height is done by either:    Interpolating between observations above and below the plume height, or  Extrapolating (within the surface layer) from the nearest measurement height to the plume height.

 DEPM  , 11/16/2009   ,, Dietary Exposure Potential Model   ," Existing food consumption and contaminant residue databases, typically products of nutrition and  regulatory monitoring, contain useful information to characterize dietary intake of environmental  chemicals. A PC-based model with resident database system, termed the Dietary Exposure Potential Model  (DEPM), correlates extant food information in a format for estimating daily dietary exposure and  identifying sources. Though not intended for risk analysis, DEPM is a suitable tool for designing and  interpreting exposure measurements, identifying data gaps and establishing priorities for dietary exposure  research. DEPM has been used to design exposure measurement studies by estimating the importance of  diet relative to other exposure pathways. The potential for high exposure of certain populations, caused by  above normal consumption of a particular food, a highly contaminated food, or unique dietary  characteristics, is useful information when designing exposure studies or interpreting measurements of  contaminants in composited diet samples.   The current version of the DEPM (V5.0) has evolved from a process that inventoried available food  consumption and food residue databases and integrated them in a format conducive for dietary exposure  modeling. Numerous enhancements to previous versions (V2.3, 1996; V3.3.2, 2000 and V4.0, 2002) have  been incorporated based on feedback received from reviewers and new and updated resident databases  have been included as they became available.

 ECOSAR  , 07/02/2010  ,, Ecological Structure Activity Relationships  ," Ecological Structure Activity Relationships, v1.00a, February 2009  ECOSAR (Ecological Structure Activity Relationships) is a personal computer software program that is  used to estimate the toxicity of chemicals used in industry and discharged into water. The program predicts  the toxicity of industrial chemicals to aquatic organisms such as fish, invertebrates, and algae by using  Structure Activity Relationships (SARs). The program estimates a chemical's acute (short-term) toxicity  and, when available, chronic (long-term or delayed) toxicity. ECOSAR uses SARs to predict the effective  concentrations (EC) from chemical structure; structure via SMILES or chemical class functional groups;  SARs sorted by chemical class. SARs express the correlations between a compound's physicochemical  properties and its aquatic toxicity. SARs measured for one compound can be used to predict the toxicity of  similar compounds belonging to the same chemical class. ECOSAR v1.00a contains over 120 chemical  classes and over 440 SARs based on publicly available and confidential experimental data.

 EFDC  , 11/16/2009  ,, Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code  ," The Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC)is a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model that can be  used to simulate aquatic systems in one, two, and three dimensions. It has evolved over the past two  decades to become one of the most widely used and technically defensible hydrodynamic models in the  world. EFDC uses stretched or sigma vertical coordinates and Cartesian or curvilinear, orthogonal  horizontal coordinates to represent the physical characteristics of a waterbody. It solves three-dimensional,  vertically hydrostatic, free surface, turbulent averaged equations of motion for a variable-density fluid.  Dynamically-coupled transport equations for turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent length scale, salinity and  temperature are also solved. The EFDC model allows for drying and wetting in shallow areas by a mass  conservation scheme. The physics of the EFDC model and many aspects of the computational scheme are  equivalent to the widely used Blumberg-Mellor model and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Chesapeake Bay  model. EFDC will provide necessary hydrodynamic inputs to WASP, the advanced receiving water quality  model.

 EMSOFT  , 08/31/2009  ,, EMSOFT  ," Chemicals that readily vaporize at relatively low temperatures can migrate from contaminated soils into the  atmosphere via a process called volatilization. Volatilization represents a potentially significant exposure  pathway because humans can come in contact with volatilized compounds through inhalation. The  EMSOFT manual describes a computer screening model that may be used 1) to determine concentrations  of contaminants remaining in the soil over a given time (when the initial soil concentration is known); 2) to  quantify the mass flux (rate of transfer) of contaminants into the atmosphere over time; and 3) to  subsequently calculate contaminant air concentrations by inputting mass flux values into atmospheric  dispersion models. Ingestion of contaminated soil and dermal contact are also potential exposure pathways  requiring knowledge of the contaminant soil concentration to estimate potential risks. EMSOFT can also  be used by risk assessors and exposure modelers to calculate average chemical concentrations at a given  depth over time. This model, based on the theory and studies of Jury et al. (1983, 1990), addresses  situations in which contaminated soils are located at the surface and buried beneath a clean soil cover.  Through a series of menus the user is prompted for several input choices to select a calculation method,  chemical data, soil properties, and layer properties. The various calculation methods include  Time-Averaged Flux, Flux vs. Time, Time- and Depth-Averaged Soil Concentration, Depth-Averaged Soil  Concentration vs. Time and Soil Concentration vs. Depth. The user also has the option to determine cover  layer thickness; the number of contaminant layers and their corresponding thickness; and the time period   for averaging flux and soil concentration.

","  No special training is needed to operate the model; however, an awareness of basic chemical and soil  parameters would assist with inputting data and understanding the results. Much of this information is  presented in the User’s Guide.   ",,  EMSOFT is a screening model that may be used to assess the potential for such exposure to occur and  quantify the mass flux of contaminants to the atmosphere over time. Mass fluxes can then be input to an  atmospheric dispersion model to calculate exposure concentrations. Ingestion of contaminated soil and  dermal contact are also potentially important exposure pathways. This model can also be used to calculate  chemical concentrations in surficial soil layers over time for assessment of these exposures. The model  addresses situations in which contaminated soils are located at the surface and buried beneath a clean soil  cover.   ,  Based on the algorithms of William Jury.   ,"  The EMSOFT model was used with the data sets presented in Section 5.3 for the model validation. Then,  for some data sets, the model's sensitivity to parameter variability was tested by remodeling a data set with  one input, such as the Henry's law constant, set equal to a new value. This was necessary because in  searching for data for this modeling exercise, different values for some ""constants"" were cited. Also, if an  uncertainty existed in an input value selected, such as the surface boundary layer, an alternative value was  tested.   Key Limitations of Model Scope   Important limitations include:   1. The duration of experiments simulated ranged from 7 to 36 days. Model performance for longer  durations could not be validated.  2. The influence of porewater flux (evaporation and leaching) was not examined. This parameter is  difficult to specify accurately and varies over time. Jury et al. (1983) showed that emissions of some  compounds are sensitive to changes in evaporation rate.  3. Only ""no cover"" scenarios were simulated in this validation. Measurement studies of ""clean cover""  scenarios (contaminated soil covered by a layer of clean soil) were not found. As demonstrated in  some of the simulations, it is important to carefully specify the input parameters, especially those  which the model may be most sensitive to, such as Koc, foc, and KH. Parameter sensitivity of the  model is chemical- and setting-specific, and may be difficult to forecast. Therefore, performance of  sensitivity analysis for parameters with uncertain values is highly recommended.

 EPANET VERSION 2.0   , 08/31/2009   ,, EPANET VERSION 2.0   ,"  EPANET is a Windows program that performs extended period simulation of hydraulic and water-quality  behavior within pressurized pipe networks. A network can consist of pipes, nodes (pipe junctions), pumps,  valves and storage tanks or reservoirs. EPANET tracks the flow of water in each pipe, the pressure at each  node, the height of water in each tank, and the concentration of a chemical species throughout the network  during a simulation period comprised of multiple time steps. In addition to chemical species, water age and  source tracing can also be simulated.   EPANET provides a fully equipped, extended period hydraulic analysis package, which can:  Handle systems of any size    Compute friction head loss using either Hazen-Williams, Darcy-Weisbach, or Chezy-Manning  equations  Include minor head losses for bends, fittings, etc.  Model constant or variable speed pumps  Compute pumping energy and cost  Model various types of valves including shutoff, check, pressure regulating, and flow control valves  Allow storage tanks to have any shape (i.e., diameter can vary with height)  Consider multiple demand categories at nodes, each with its own pattern of time variation  Model pressure-dependent flow issuing from emitters (sprinkler heads)  Base system operation on simple tank level or timer controls as well as on complex rule-based  controls.  In addition , EPANET's water quality analyzer can:    Model the movement of a non-reactive tracer material through the network over time  Model the movement and fate of a reactive material as it grows (e.g., a disinfection by-product) or  decays (e.g., chlorine residual) with time  Model the age of water throughout a network  Track the percent of flow from a given node reaching all other nodes over time  Model reactions both in the bulk flow and at the pipe wall  Allow growth or decay reactions to proceed up to a limiting concentration  Employ global reaction rate coefficients that can be modified on a pipe-by-pipe basis  Allow for time-varying concentration or mass inputs at any location in the network  Model storage tanks as being either complete mix, plug flow, or two-compartment reactors.  EPANET's Windows user interface provides a visual network editor that simplifies the process of building  piping network models and editing their properties. Various data reporting and visualization tools are used  to assist in interpreting the results of a network analysis. These include graphical views (time series plots,  profile plots, contour plots, etc.), tabular views, and special reports (energy usage, reaction, and calibration  reports).

 FIRST  , 11/16/2009   ,, FQPA Index Reservoir Screening Tool   ,"  FIRST is a screening model designed to estimate the pesticide concentrations found in water for use in  drinking water exposure assessments. It provides high-end values on the concentrations that might be found  in a small drinking water reservoir due to the use of pesticide. FIRST is a single-event model (one run-off  event), but can account for spray drift from multiple applications. FIRST uses a Drinking Water Reservoir  as a standard waterbody. The FIRST scenario includes a 427 acres field immediately adjacent to a 13 acres  reservoir, 9 feet deep, with continuous flow (two turnovers per year). The pond receives a spray drift event  from each application plus one runoff event. The runoff event moves a maximum of 8% of the applied  pesticide into the pond. This amount can be reduced due to degradation on field and the effect of binding to  soil. Spray drift is equal to 6.4% of the applied concentration from the ground spray application and 16%  for aerial applications. FIRST also makes adjustments for the percent crop area using the highest  percentage of crop cover of any large watershed in the US and assumes that the entire crop is being treated.   “Passing” a FIRST model screening assessment (estimated concentration is lower than laboratory effects  data) is an indicator or acceptable risk. “Failing” a FIRST model screening assessment (estimated  concentration is higher than laboratory effects data) is not an indicator of unacceptable risk, but that  additional assessment work must be carried out.

 GENEEC2  , 11/16/2009   ,, Generic Estimated Environmental Concentration   ,"  The USEPA Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) is required by the Federal Insecticide Fungicide  Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to carry out a risk/benefit assessment for pesticides which are to be registered  and used in the United States. The OPP Environmental Fate and Effects Division (EFED) are charged with  carrying out both the aquatic and terrestrial ecological portions of this assessment. To assess the potential  exposure to non-target species living in water bodies in proximity to sites where a pesticide is applied,  EFED estimates pesticide aquatic exposure concentrations to which species may be exposure through  permitted use of the chemical. These concentrations are then compared to concentrations known to be toxic  from laboratory tests. This exposure / hazard (effects) ratio is used as an indication of potential risk to  organisms.   Concentrations of pesticide in surface water for an exposure/risk assessment may be estimated through a  program of monitoring (field sampling) or through computer simulation or both. As either of these options  may involve expenditure of substantial time and money, EFED has developed GENEEC2 as a simple  screening model by which the need for monitoring or more advanced computer simulation can be  determined.   EFED had several criteria for development of a screening model of this type. First, the model should be  fast and easy to use. Second, it should require only a few, readily available input parameters. Third, the  input parameters should be those most significant to represent pesticide amount and type of application as  well as transport to and persistence in surface water. Fourth, the predicted concentration values should be   (1) higher than most of the highest of the concentration values predicted in the next higher tier of modeling  and (2) higher than most of the upper level concentration values that are measured in the field at vulnerable  sites. The last requirement is design to preclude the possibility that a potentially hazardous chemical pass  the screen early in the assessment process and escape sufficient review. A vulnerable site is defined as one  at which high concentration levels are expected due to the occurrence of those conditions of pesticide  application, weather, and soils known to favor transport to and persistence in surface water.  The GENEEC2 model was developed to meet these criteria. GENEEC2 uses a vulnerable standard  field-rural water body watershed (referred to as “standard pond”) scenario which was selected for all  screening level drinking water exposure assessments. This scenario assumes that sufficient rain falls on a  ten-hectare, treated field to cause up to ten percent of the applied pesticide to run off into a one hectare,  two-meter deep pond. Using the method, all pesticides can be compared under the same conditions.   “Passing” a GENEEC2 screening assessment (estimated concentration is lower than laboratory effects data)  is an indicator or acceptable risk. “Failing” a GENEEC2 screening assessment (estimated concentration is  higher than laboratory effects data) is not an indicator of unacceptable risk, but that additional assessment  work must be carried out.

 HADCM3  , 11/16/2009   ,, Hadley Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General  Circulation Model   ,"  HadCM3 is a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) developed at the Hadley  Centre and described by Gordon et al (2000) and Pope et al (2000). Unlike earlier AOGCMs at the Hadley  Centre and elsewhere (including HadCM2), HadCM3 does not need flux adjustment (additional ""artificial""  heat and freshwater fluxes at the ocean surface) to produce a good simulation. The higher ocean resolution  of HadCM3 is a major factor in this. HadCM3 has been run for over a thousand years, showing little drift  in its surface climate.  For additional information, see the publications listed at  http://www.metoffice.com/research/hadleycentre/pubs/index.html, and those highlighted at  http://www.metoffice.com/research/hadleycentre/models/HadCM3.html   ",  ,,"  EPA contact: Brooke L. Hemming, Ph.D.  Tel: 919-541-5668  E-mail: hemming.brooke@epa.gov   Other: The Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research  http://www.metoffice.com/research/hadleycentre/index.html hadley@metoffice.gov.uk    ", , , http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/hadleycentre/    , , ,,,  Please contact the UK Met Office staff   ,  Please contact the UK Met Office staff   ,  Please contact the UK Met Office staff   ,,  Please contact the UK Met Office staff   ,,  Please contact the UK Met Office staff   ,  Please contact the UK Met Office staff   ,,   Please contact the UK Met Office staff   , , , ,,"  As with all GCMs, the fundamental scientific basis of the HadCM3 model is the numerical solution on a  discretized domain of the basic fluid mechanical equations governing atmospheric and oceanic flow, along  with representations of physical/thermodynamic processes such as radiative transfer, turbulence,  convection and the formation of clouds and precipitation, plant physiology, soil heat and water dynamics,  etc. “Coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) These are the most complex  models in use, consisting of an AGCM coupled to an OGCM. Some recent models include the biosphere,  carbon cycle and atmospheric chemistry as well. AOGCMs can be used for the prediction and rate of  change of future climate. They are also used to study the variability and physical processes of the coupled  climate system. Global climate models typically have a resolution of a few hundred kilometres. Climate  projections from the Hadley Centre make use of the HadCM2 AOGCM, developed in 1994, and its  successor HadCM3 AOGCM, developed in 1998. Greenhouse-gas experiments with AOGCMs have  usually been driven by specifying atmospheric concentrations of the gases, but if a carbon cycle model is  included, the AOGCM can predict changes in carbon dioxide concentration, given the emissions of carbon  dioxide into the atmosphere. At the Hadley Centre, this was first done in 1999. Similarly, an AOGCM  coupled to an atmospheric chemistry model is able to predict the changes in concentration of other  atmospheric constituents in response to climate change and to the changing emissions of various gases.  Further information is available on: some aspects of ocean simulation in HadCM3 (thermohaline  circulation, ventilation, vertical mixing), decadal variability in the ocean of HadCM3.”   ","  The atmospheric component of HadCM3 has 19 levels with a horizontal resolution of 2.5° of latitude by  3.75° of longitude, which produces a global grid of 96 x 73 grid cells. This is equivalent to a surface  resolution of about 417 km x 278 km at the Equator, reducing to 295 km x 278 km at 45° of latitude. The  radiative effects of CO2, water vapour, ozone, minor greenhouse gases, and background aerosols are  explicitly represented. A penetrative convective scheme is used, modified to include an explicit  down-draught, and the direct impact of convection on momentum. Recently updated parametrizations of  orographic and gravity wave drag are also included. The large-scale precipitation and cloud scheme is  formulated in terms of an explicit cloud water variable. The atmospheric component of the model also  optionally allows the emission, transport, oxidation and deposition of sulphur compounds  (dimethylsulphide, sulphur dioxide and ammonium sulphate) to be simulated interactively. This permits the  direct and indirect forcing effects of sulphate aerosols to be modelled given scenarios for sulphur  emissions and oxidants.   More Information Below   Key Limitations to Model Scope   The oceanic component of HadCM3 has 20 levels with a horizontal resolution of 1.25 x 1.25°. Horizontal  mixing of tracers uses a version of the Gent and McWilliams adiabatic diffusion scheme with a variable  thickness diffusivity. There is no explicit horizontal diffusion of tracers. The along-isopycnal diffusivity of  tracers is 1000 m2 s-1 and horizontal momentum viscosity varies with latitude between 3000 and 6000 m2  s-1 at the poles and equator respectively. Near-surface vertical mixing is parametrized partly by a  Kraus-Turner mixed layer scheme for tracers, and a K-theory scheme for momentum. Convective  adjustment is modified in the region of the Denmark Straits and Iceland-Scotland ridge better to represent  down-slope mixing of the overflow water. Mediterranean water is partially mixed with Atlantic water  across the Strait of Gibraltar as a simple representation of water mass exchange since the channel is not   resolved in the model. The model is initialized directly from an observed ocean state at rest, with a suitable  atmospheric and sea ice state. The atmosphere and ocean exchange information once per day. Heat and  water fluxes are conserved exactly in the transfer between their different grids.   Case Studies   The sea ice model uses a simple thermodynamic scheme including leads and snow-cover. Ice is advected  by the surface ocean current, with convergence prevented when the depth exceeds 4 m. There is no explicit  representation of iceberg calving, so a prescribed water flux is returned to the ocean at a rate calibrated to  balance the net snowfall accumulation on the ice sheets, geographically distributed within regions where  icebergs are found. In order to avoid a global average salinity drift, surface water fluxes are converted to  surface salinity fluxes using a constant reference salinity of 35 PSU.  A new land surface scheme includes a representation of the freezing and melting of soil moisture, as well  as surface runoff and soil drainage; the formulation of evaporation includes the dependence of stomatal  resistance on temperature, vapour pressure and CO2 concentration. The surface albedo is a function of  snow depth, vegetation type and also of temperature over snow and ice.

 HSPF  , 02/22/2011   ,, HYDROLOGICAL SIMULATIONPROGRAM FORTRAN   ,"  HSPF can be used to simulate water and constituent movement within both watersheds and their receiving  waterbodies including rivers, streams, and well-mixed lakes and reservoirs. The model can be applied to  watersheds of various sizes, and can handle both rural and urban land uses. On impervious land, HSPF  simulates build-up and washoff of pollutants, and subsequent delivery into streams, but does not explicitly  simulate movement through storm drainage networks. HSPF was initially developed in the early 80's based  on the Stanford Watershed Model (SWM) and four other models.   HSPF is a continuous-simulation, lumped parameter model that is driven by meteorological data, typically  using a one-hour time step.   The model has algorithms to simulate the major features of hydrology within a watershed (rainfall- runoff,  evapotranspiration, interception, snowmelt, interflow, groundwater discharge to streams, etc.), and can  simulate the fate and transport of a wide variety of pollutants as they move over and through the landscape,  and into and through a stream network.   HSPF can simulate both point and non-point sources of pollutants. Organized in modules defined largely by  pollutant categories, the model can simulate conservative tracers, sediments in three size classes, pesticides,  nutrients, and general quality constituents.   Conservative tracers are modeled according to simple transport with no on-land or in-stream   reactions;   Sediment simulation processes include scour and gully erosion on the land surface, and sediment   deposition and scour in stream and river reaches;   Pesticide fate and transport includes a number of degradation processes and adsorption/desorption;   Phosphorous and nitrogen are modeled with complete on-land and in-stream nutrient cycle reactions   involving oxygen, heat balance, and phytoplankton;   General quality constituents are any user-specified pollutant that can be reasonably represented by a  build-up/washoff phenomenon on land segments and by first order degradation in reaches and/or  reservoirs.

Provide the capability of tracking human pathogens, toxic chemicals, and radioactive substances that  pose significant threats to public safety in case they were used to attack water sources.  ","  The formulation used in ICWater for time-of-travel is based upon the velocity (V)—discharge (Q)  relationship: V=aQb. The defining work for this relationship was based on current meter measurements of  velocity and stream hydraulic factors reported by Leopold and Maddock (1953). The relationship is  affirmed in observational dye studies reported, for example, by Kilpatrick and Wilson (1989), Lee (1995),  Jobson (1996), and Smith (2002). The relationship has been used successfully in previous investigations  such as Gates (1982), QUAL2E(EPA 1987), and Maidment (1993).   ICWater models contaminating substances released, instantaneously or continuously, into surface waters of  the U.S. The substances are moved downstream based upon USGS real-time flow information (or  alternative flow values provided by the user). The time dependent distribution of contaminant   concentrations, simulated by modeled dispersion, dilution and substance decay, is reported for  contaminants arriving at drinking water intakes. Mean flows and velocities in the NHD are scaled by the  real-time flow and velocity from nearby gages.

It also depicts changes in consumption patterns due to demographic  changes, price and income effects.   The main driver of economic growth in this model is capital accumulation and technological change.  Capital accumulation arises from savings of a household that is modeled as an economic actor with  “perfect foresight.” Aggregate household consumption and savings are chosen to maximize a utility  function that is a discounted sum of the stream of future consumption. Within each period, the  consumption – or demand – side of the model is driven by a detailed model of household demand that  includes demographic characteristics.   The production – or supply – side of the model characterizes the industrial structure in detail. 35 industries  are identified, of which 21 are manufacturing and 5 are energy related, these are listed in Table 1. Each  industry produces output using capital, labor, energy and non-energy intermediate inputs using constant  returns to scale technology. The production technology used changes over time due to both exogenously  specified changes and endogenous changes from price effects. Coal, refined oil and gas are separately  identified energy inputs. The output from domestic industries is supplemented by imports from the rest of  the world to form the total supply of each commodity.

 IPM  , 08/25/2009   ,, INTEGRATED PLANNING MODEL - EPA APPLICATIONS   ,"  The Integrated Planning Model (IPM) is a multi-regional, dynamic, deterministic linear programming (LP)  model of the electric power sector in the continental lower 48 states and the District of Columbia. It  provides 20-30 year forecasts of least-cost capacity expansion, electricity dispatch, and emission control  strategies for meeting energy demand and environmental, transmission, dispatch, and reliability constraints.  IPM can be used to evaluate the cost and emissions impacts of proposed policies to limit emissions of  sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), carbon dioxide (CO2), and mercury (Hg) from the electric  power sector.   IPM provides a detail-rich representation of the U.S. electric power system. Over 15,000 existing and  planned/committed generating units in the U.S. electric system are mapped to approximately 1,700 model  plants, each designed to capture the specific cost, performance, and emission characteristics of the units it  represents. The model also provides a very detailed representation of coal supply choices available to the  power sector. It distinguishes coal by rank (bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite), sulfur and mercury  content, and differentiates approximately 40 distinct supply regions (each with its own set of supply  curves) and a comparable number of demand regions.

It incorporates well established engineering and  economic principles to capture the behavior of the electric generating system. It employs a LP formulation  to find the system-wide optimal (i.e., least cost) strategy for the power system to achieve emission limits  while meeting electricity demand and other operating constraints.   IPM is a dynamic linear programming model that generates optimal decisions under perfect foresight for a  specified planning period. It determines the least-cost method of meeting energy and peak demand  requirements over a specified period. In its solution, the model considers a number of key operating or  regulatory constraints (e.g. emission limits, transmission capabilities, renewable generation requirements,  fuel market constraints) that are placed on the power and fuel markets. In particular, the model is  well-suited to consider complex treatment of emission regulations involving trading, banking, and  progressive flow control of emission allowances, as well as traditional command-and-control emission  policies.   IPM models power markets through model regions that are geographical entities with distinct  characteristics. For example, the model regions representing the U.S. power market in EPA applications  correspond broadly to regions and sub-regions constituting the North American Electric Reliability  Council (NERC) regions. IPM models the electric demand, generation, and transmission between regions.  All existing utility power generation units, including renewable resources, are modeled, as well as  independent power producers and cogeneration facilities that sell electricity to the grid.

IPM's objective function, key decision variables and constraints are described  here:   Objective Function: IPM's objective function is the sum of all costs incurred by the electricity sector over  the entire planning horizon. The total resulting cost is expressed as the net present value (NPV) of all  component costs. These costs, which the linear programming formulation attempts to minimize, include  the cost of new plant and pollution control construction, fixed and variable operating and maintenance  costs, and fuel costs. Many of these cost are captured in the objective function by multiplying the decision  variables, described below, by a cost coefficient. Cost escalation factors are used in the objective function  to reflect changes in cost over time. The applicable discount rates are applied to derive the NPV for the  entire planning horizon from the costs obtained for all years in the planning horizon.   More Information is provided in ""Scientific Detail for the Model"" and ""Model Framework"", below.   ","  Quality assurance and verification of code is routinely performed by ICF Resources, Inc. in accordance  with an approved Quality Assurance Project Plan and contractual provisions with EPA. Model inputs and  results are corroborated through extensive review and comment by EPA stakeholders. Sensitivity analyses  are routinely performed by EPA and key model runs are posted on the web site noted above in (B)3d.  Uncertainty analysis exercises are under development. IPM is regularly used in comparative modeling  exercises sponsored by Stanford University’s Energy Modeling Forum and other organizations.

A key data management feature of this system is that it uses a  Microsoft Access database to manage model data and weather text files for driving the simulation. The  system also contains a module to assist in TMDL calculation and source allocations. For each model run, it  automatically generates comprehensive text-file output by subwatershed for all land-layers, reaches, and  simulated modules, which can be expressed on hourly or daily intervals. Output from LSPC has been  linked to other model applications such as EFDC, WASP, and CE-QUAL-W2. LSPC has no inherent  limitations in terms of modeling size or model operations.

 MAGICC/SCENGEN  , 10/07/2009  ,, Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change/Scenario Generator   ,"  MAGICC consists of a suite of coupled gas-cycle, climate and ice-melt models integrated into a single  software package. The software allows the user to determine changes in greenhouse-gas concentrations,  global-mean surface air temperature, and sea level resulting from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse  gases and aerosols.   SCENGEN constructs a range of geographically explicit climate change projections for the globe using the  results from MAGICC together with AOGCM climate change information from the Coupled Model  Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) archive. Projections of absolute (rather than relative) future climate  conditions for any future date covered by the input emissions data can be obtained also. To produce these  projections, SCENGEN adds the climate change information to observed baseline climate data (1980-99  means). These results are given as array files on a standard 2.5x2.5 degree latitude/longitude grid and  displayed as maps.

To determine the sensitivity of the temperature and sea level results for any chosen emissions  scenario to changes in and uncertainties in model parameters, such as the climate sensitivity. Basic  uncertainty ranges and a ""best-estimate"" result are calculated by default. In addition, the user may  select a set of model parameters that differs from the best-estimate set to examine uncertainties  associated with model parameter uncertainties in more detail.  SCENGEN displays MAGICC output spatially. Beyond simple climate change scenario construction (i.e.,  changes in the mean climate state), SCENGEN produces spatial pattern results for: changes in inter-annual  variability; two different forms of signal-to-noise ratio (to assess the significance of changes); probabilistic  output (the default being the probability of an increase in the chosen climate variable); and a wide range of  model validation statistics for individual models or combinations of models to assist in the selection of  models for scenario development.   ","  The climate model in MAGICC is an upwelling-diffusion, energy-balance model that produces global- and  hemispheric-mean temperature output together with results for oceanic thermal expansion. The 5.3 version  of the software is consistent with the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, Working Group 1 (AR4). The  MAGICC climate model is coupled interactively with a range of gas-cycle models that give projections for  the concentrations of the key greenhouse gases. Climate feedbacks on the carbon cycle are therefore  accounted for.   Global-mean temperatures from MAGICC are used to drive SCENGEN. SCENGEN uses a version of the  pattern scaling method described in Santer et al. (1990) to produce spatial patterns of change from a data  base of atmosphere/ocean GCM (AOGCM) data from the CMIP3/AR4 archive. The pattern scaling method  is based on the separation of the global-mean and spatial-pattern components of future climate change, and  the further separation of the latter into greenhouse-gas and aerosol components. Spatial patterns in the data   base are normalized and expressed as changes per 1°C change in global-mean temperature. These  normalized greenhouse-gas and aerosol components are appropriately weighted, added, and scaled up to  the global-mean temperature defined by MAGICC for a given year, emissions scenario and set of climate  model parameters. For the SCENGEN scaling component, the user can select from a number of different  AOGCMs for the patterns of greenhouse-gas-induced climate.

Max-Planck-Institut für Meteorologie Report No. 47, Hamburg, Germany,  29 pp.   ","  A key aspect of MAGICC is that it is able to emulate the global-mean temperature results of more complex  AOGCMs. This is done via calibration of MAGICC parameters (such as the climate sensitivity) to obtain  best fits to the more complex models. In this mode, MAGICC has been used in all IPCC reports to date to  extend and generalize AOGCM results. Technical details of MAGICC, details of AOGCM calibrations,  and a range of sensitivity analyses are given in:   Meinshausen, M., S. C. B. Raper and T. M. L. Wigley (2008).

The  description/discussion/analysis is germane to the current publicly available version, v5.3. The carbon cycle  model in version 6.0 is able to emulate results for any of the models in the C4MIP archive. Version 5.3’s  carbon cycle model has been calibrated to give results consistent with the mean of the models in this  archive.)   ","  For some areas, there are still significant developments to be expected in the realism of both climate and  carbon cycle models. For example, the current state-of-the-art carbon cycle models themselves face  substantial uncertainties, related to, for example, nitrogen-fertilization, modeling of fire regimes, ocean  chemistry, etc.   A second limitation (for SCENGEN) arises from the incomplete knowledge on the patterns of climate  model response to aerosol forcing, particularly indirect forcing. The limitation here is that the required  AOGCM ‘single forcing’ experiments have not yet been done with state-of-the-art AOGCMs.   Thirdly, there are uncertainties as to how AOGCM and carbon cycle models would behave for scenarios  outside the tested range.

 MEASURE  , 03/31/2011   ,, MOBILE EMISSIONS ASSESSMENT SYSTEM FOR  URBAN AND REGIONAL EVALUATION   ,"  A working research model for Atlanta, GA has been developed by Georgia Tech, and is called the Mobile  Emissions Assessment System for Urban and Regional Evaluation (MEASURE). The EPA Office of  Research and Development has developed an additional implementation of the MEASURE research model  for the Research Triangle Park, NC area. The MEASURE emissions modeling concept will benefit state  and local air quality agencies, local metropolitan planning organizations, or academic research  organizations to further their understanding of current transportation emissions sources as well as to model  future transportation control strategies. At present, MEASURE focuses on estimating emissions for ozone  precursor pollutants (volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide) and has limited  emission estimation capabilities for other pollutants. In the future, better characterization of particulate  matter and hazardous air pollutant (air toxic) emissions is planned.   MEASURE includes the following advancements to the state-of-the-art highway vehicle emissions   modeling:   Advanced modeling of emissions rate characteristics of different vehicle technology groups;   Advanced modeling of vehicles based on power demand characteristics;   Advanced modeling of vehicles as a function of a vehicle's mode of operation;   Characterization of physical transportation networks in terms of spatially distributed attributes (e.g.,   road grade) that affect vehicle modal operations; and   Integration of model development and application in a GIS environment, linking spatially arrayed   vehicle distribution, vehicle usage, and behavior, and transportation network characteristics and   volume flows.   The basis for this model is modal, which refers to the modes of engine operation that a vehicle may be in  at any given point in time such as engine start, idle, hot stabilized operation, enrichment conditions  (influenced by high acceleration and power demand), hot soak evaporation, etc. Within the current model  design, a variety of vehicle activities, environmental factors, vehicle and driver characteristics are  considered as well as the spatial and temporal distributions of these vehicle and driver characteristics.   On- and off-network components are included in the model. On-network components refer to vehicle  activity on major roadway links such as interstates, major arterials, etc. Traffic volumes, speeds, temporal  distributions, and fleet characteristics are included for network components. Off-network components refer  to vehicle activity on local roads and streets. Typically, these local roads are aggregated into  mini-transportation analysis zones. Off-network activities are derived from socioeconomic and  environmental data (i.e., population, housing, employment, land use) and aggregated on a zone basis.   Fleet composition is an important factor in the model. This is due to the numerous vehicle parameters that  are used to determine emission rates. These vehicle parameters include vehicle class, emitter class, model  year, gross vehicle weight, engine displacement, and fuel injection and control system technology.  Additionally, these vehicles have spatial variations throughout an urban area with correlations to certain  socio-economic data (e.g., population, housing income). The fleet for a given area is subdivided into   socio-economic data (e.g., population, housing income). The fleet for a given area is subdivided into  various technology groups and these groups are tracked within the model. Emission rates are applied  separately to each technology group. The emission rate algorithms included in the model are based upon  statistical analysis of emissions data and will be determined for all the modes that are included in the  model.

 MENTOR-1A  , 08/31/2009   ,, Modeling Environment for Total Risk-1A   ,"  MENTOR-1A uses an integrated, mechanistically consistent source-to-dose modeling framework to  quantify inhalation exposure and dose for individuals and/or populations due to co-occurring air pollutants.  It uses the ""One Atmosphere"" concept to characterize simultaneous exposures to multiple atmospheric  contaminants taking into account their physical and chemical interactions. MENTOR-1A uses, as one of  the options, the USEPA’s Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation (SHEDS) approach.  MENTOR-1A characterizes cumulative exposures to co-occurring air pollutants, and calculates exposure  and dose profiles, while providing the ability to focus on mechanism-relevant time scales and  subpopulations of interest. This is achieved by combining information, as per the needs of a specific  application, on: demographic characteristics of the population under study, outdoor concentration  distributions, indoor/outdoor air exchange rates, indoor sources, time-activity diaries, and biologically  based dosimetry. It uses the two dimensional Monte-Carlo methodology to quantify variability and  uncertainty in model inputs and outputs.  MENTOR-1A can be used for both “Individual Based Exposure Modeling” (IBEM) and “Population Based  Exposure Modeling” (PBEM) approaches. Both these approaches employ a “Person Oriented Modeling”  (POM) formulation, i.e. they are driven by the attributes and activities of the exposed “real” and/or “virtual”  individual(s). While IBEM implementations utilize the information relevant to “actual” individuals (and  produce exposure and dose estimates specific to each one of them), the PBEM implementations focus on  the statistical characterization of the exposures and doses of selected populations (at the census tract,  county, or state etc. level). Thus, the questions posed by any particular environmental health problem can  be tailored to small sets of individuals potentially at risk or to larger populations or subpopulations of  interest.  MENTOR-1A has been applied to date to simulate (a) regional potential population exposures and (b)  urban population exposures and doses to co-occurring gas phase pollutants and particulate matter.  Specifically it has been applied to criteria pollutants such as ozone, and PM2.5, and to air toxics such as  benzene, formaldehyde and xylene. Additionally, MENTOR-1A has been applied to simulate longer term  (year long) exposures to reactive and relatively inert air pollutants, and has also been applied to estimate  study-specific exposures and doses to selected air toxics in multiple cities.

This requires development and application of  computational models that are capable of representing these relationships at spatial scales ranging from  geographic regions to personal and residential microenvironments.  The MENTOR toolbox is an open and “flexible” system that provides components for performing either  simple (screening) or detailed (comprehensive) simulations at various scales and levels of detail.  MENTOR-1A provides modules for assessing individual and population exposures and doses to multiple,  co-occurring chemicals.  The approach of MENTOR has been to develop, apply and evaluate state-of-the-art modeling methods for a  wide range of environmental applications, that utilize existing models, when available, or provide new  approaches to “fill gaps” in the source-to-dose sequence.

 MENTOR-4M  , 07/11/2011   ,, Modeling Environment for Total Risk-4M   ,"  MENTOR-4M uses an integrated, mechanistically consistent, source-to-dose modeling framework to  quantify simultaneous exposures and doses of individuals and populations to multiple contaminants. It is  an implementation of the MENTOR system for exposures to Multiple contaminants from Multiple media,  Multiple routes, and Multiple pathways (4M). MENTOR-4M uses, as one of the options, the USEPA’s  Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation approach.   MENTOR-4M combines microenvironmental and human activities characterization to assess the relative  contribution of (1) media (e.g., water, food, dust), (2) pathways (e.g., drinking water, diet, hand-to-mouth)  and (3) routes (e.g., oral, inhalation, dermal) to (4) multiple contaminant (e.g. VOCs and heavy metals)  exposures for individuals or populations. It addresses aggregate and cumulative exposures to co-occurring  pollutants in a consistent manner, and provides the ability to focus on mechanism-relevant time scales and  subpopulations of interest. It uses two dimensional Monte-Carlo methodology to quantify variability and  uncertainty in model inputs and outputs.   MENTOR-1A can be used for both “Individual Based Exposure Modeling” (IBEM) and “Population Based  Exposure Modeling” (PBEM) approaches. Both these approaches employ a “Person Oriented Modeling”  (POM) formulation, i.e. they are driven by the attributes and activities of the exposed “real” and/or “virtual”  individual(s). While IBEM implementations utilize the information relevant to “actual” individuals (and  produce exposure and dose estimates specific to each one of them), the PBEM implementations focus on  the statistical characterization of the exposures and doses of selected populations (at the census tract,  county, or state etc. level). Thus, the questions posed by any particular environmental health problem can  be tailored to small sets of individuals potentially at risk or to larger populations or subpopulations of  interest.   To date, demonstration applications of the model have focused on simulating aggregate/cumulative  exposures to arsenic, copper, mercury/methylmercury, and trichloroethylene (TCE); populations studied  have included NHEXAS-V study subjects and residents in Oswego county, NY.

This requires development and application of  computational models that are capable of representing these relationships at spatial scales ranging from  geographic regions to personal and residential microenvironments.   The MENTOR toolbox is an open and “flexible” system that provides components for performing either  simple (screening) or detailed (comprehensive) simulations at various scales and levels of detail.

The first  two case studies above considered the exposure routes of inhalation and drinking water consumption only,  while the third study (Franklin County, OH) took into account the additional exposure routes of food intake  and non-dietary ingestion. In the Franklin County case study, the model results were evaluated by  comparing predicted distributions of (a) total arsenic amounts in urine and of (b) TCE blood concentrations  for the population studied with those measured in the National Human Exposure Assessment Survey  (NHEXAS) Region-V study. The agreement of distributions of biomarker levels calculated from  MENTOR/SHEDS-4M and measured in the NHEXAS-Region V study was satisfactory.

 MINTEQA2  , 12/09/2009   ,, MINTEQA2   ,"  MINTEQA2 is a equilibrium speciation model that can be used to calculate the equilibrium composition of  dilute aqueous solutions in the laboratory or in natural aqueous systems. The model is useful for calculating  the equilibrium mass distribution among dissolved species, adsorbed species, and multiple solid phases  under a variety of conditions including a gas phase with constant partial pressures. A comprehensive data  base is included that is adequate for solving a broad range of problems without need for additional  user-supplied equilibrium constants. The model employs a pre-defined set of components that includes free  ions such as Na+ and neutral and charged complexes (e.g., H4SiO40, Cr(OH)2+). The data base of  reactions is written in terms of these components as reactants. An ancillary program, PRODEFA2, serves  as an interactive pre-processor to help produce the required MINTEQA2 input files.   Documentation   Several modifications important to the user have been made since the last publication of a  MINTEQA2/PRODEFA2 user manual Two documents supplement the original user's manual file  (USERMANU.PDF) and are included--along with the original user's manual--with the release of versions   4.01 and 4.02 of the MINTEQA2 model system. The file:  SUPPLE1.PDF supplements the basic information in the version 3.11 user's manual and describes  significant changes since version 3.0  SUPPLE2.PDF outlines the development of the data base of diffuse-layer sorption reactions for  hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) to be used in equilibrium speciation calculations for the Hazardous Waste  Identification Rule (HWIR)   Significant changes in the MINTEQA2/PRODEFA2 model since the publication of the version 3.11 user  manual include: Incorporation of the Gaussian model for computing trace metal complexation with  dissolved organic matter, modifications to minimize the occurrence of violations of Gibbs phase rule,  modifications to allow direct simulation of a titration in one model run, modifications to allow selected  output to be written for easy importing to a spreadsheet, modifications to improve model execution speed  and convergence, and modifications to improve the thermodynamic data base used by the model, including  the addition of beryllium (II), cobalt (II and III), molybdenum VI), and tin (II and IV) compounds. Also,  errors in thermodynamic constants associated with certain metal-organic reactions in earlier versions have  been corrected in version 4.01, thermodynamic constants for inorganic species have been reviewed and  updated, and all reference citations for equilibrium constants have been included in the revised data base.  These and other revisions are described in the file SUPPLE1.PDF.   The file SUPPLE2.PDF outlines the development of the data base of diffuse-layer sorption reactions for  hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) to be used in equilibrium speciation calculations for the Hazardous Waste  Identification Rule (HWIR). The sorption of contaminant metals and metalloids is important in that it  retards contaminant transport in the subsurface. In HWIR, the results of the speciation modeling are used to  compute the contaminant sorption distribution coefficient, Kd, a transport model parameter that must be  included to account for this retardation. The contaminant metals and metalloids of interest in HWIR are:  arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), barium (Ba), beryllium (Be), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co),  copper (Cu), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), selenium (Se), silver (Ag), thallium   copper (Cu), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), selenium (Se), silver (Ag), thallium  (Tl), tin (Sn), vanadium (V), and zinc (Zn). Although not a metal, cyanide (CN) is also of interest as a  transportable contaminant. A consistent set of sorption reactions are presented for all HWIR contaminants  of interest.

It covers not only municipalities, but local enterprise funds (e.g.  the local sewer or drinking water authority) and municipally or locally owned utilities (e.g the city provides  electricity to its residents). Since most of our enforcement professionals do not have the capability of  reviewing municipal or enterprise financial records to determine the validity of these inability to pay  claims, EPA developed a relatively simple tool that can help us evaluate these claims. MUNIPAY  examines financial data that the party submits directly to the EPA. MUNIPAY determines how much the  party has in currently available funds, and how much money the party could safely raise through issuing   additional debt (to be repaid through higher taxes and/or user fees). Then the model adds these figures  together to determine how much the party can afford. It requires no knowledge of accounting, finance or  computers. MUNIPAY also requires the user to input the cost of compliance, clean-up and a proposed civil  penalty amount. The model also conducts a socio-demographic analysis of the community involved to give  context to the financial analysis. If the model indicates the defendant is close to it affordability limit, and  the socio-demographic analysis indicates the community’s economic base is deteriorating rapidly, the  affordability analysis will probably need adjusting.   ","  For the socio-demographic analysis, the model takes data from the current US Census and compares it to  data from the previous census to determine if any significant trends exist to bolster or undermine the  financial analysis. Then it looks at the excess cash flow to which the entity has access. If that amount of  money is insufficient to cover all the compliance and clean up expenses along with any civil penalties, then  the model evaluates how much money this entity can borrow to see if that is sufficient to cover  environmental expenditures and civil penalties.   ","  For QA/QC, the contractor verified that calculations were similar to those an independent financial analyst  might perform.

Summary of Model Structure and Methods   The non-CO2 marginal abatement cost analysis tool employs a bottom-up analysis of mitigation option  breakeven prices. To construct the marginal abatement curves, mitigation options are applied to the  emission baseline of each economic sector. A cost/benefit analysis for each mitigation option is conducted.  A technical abatement potential is calculated for each mitigation option in each sector, equal to an option’s  technical applicability multiplied by its implied adoption rate multiplied by its reduction efficiency.  Breakeven prices are then calculated for mitigation options to determine at what carbon price a mitigation  option becomes economically viable (i.e., where the net present value of the benefits of the option equals  the net present value of the costs of implementing the option). Marginal abatement curves (MACs) are  determined by the series of breakeven price calculations for the suite of available options for each sector  and region. Each point along the curve indicates the abatement potential given the economically feasible  mitigation technologies at a given carbon price. The result of this analysis are a series of MACs that reflect  aggregated breakeven prices for implementing mitigation options in a given sector and region.   The spreadsheet model consists of a series of cost datasets, baseline and projected emissions data, specific  mitigation technologies, and other sector specific data. After selecting the region and sector to analyze, the  appropriate tax rate and discount rate is inputted for the scenario to be run. The spreadsheet model  calculates the relevant cost/benefit data for the selected region and sector from the included data sets. The  cost/benefit data is used to calculate the breakeven price.

The model calculates past, present, and future emission inventories (i.e., tons of pollutant) for  all nonroad equipment categories except commercial marine, locomotives, and aircraft. The model  estimates exhaust and evaporative hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx),  particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon dioxide (CO2). Fuel types included in the model  are: gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas, and liquefied petroleum. NONROAD2008 also has the ability  to model the effects of ethanol blends on evaporative permeation emissions. The user may select a specific  geographic area (i.e., national, state, or county) and time period (i.e., annual, monthly, seasonal, or daily)  for analysis.   The model is typically used for regulatory analyses, strategic planning, and State Implementation Plans.   NONROAD has three modules: a graphical user interface (GUI) coded in Visual Basic, a calculation  module coded in FORTRAN, and a reporting utility created from MS Access (MS Access is not needed to  run the reporting utility.).   Using the graphical user interface, the user can direct the model to temporally allocate the emissions by  tons per year, season, month, typical weekday, and typical weekend day. The user can also instruct the  model to estimate emissions at the national, state, or county level. The model can estimate past, present,  and future emissions.

NWPCAM began as a point source evaluation tool, using relatively simple  nonpoint source (NPS) estimates and basic linear modeling kinetics. The current version of NWPCAM has  evolved into a large, comprehensive Oracle-based system that incorporates additional nonlinear kinetics to  evaluate pollution control policies. The system contains a much more detailed stream network, large land  cover databases with NPS loadings estimates, and numerous modeling modules to simulate NPS and point  source policy issues.

Component 2: Database Management System Linked to the Reach File.   With RF3 as the central hydrologic construct, NWPCAM links data, such as point source loadings, NPS  loadings, and land cover data to the Reach File to support pollution control scenario definitions, models,  and analyses of results. Modeling results are incorporated into the databases to support subsequent  modeling components.   Component 3: Models.   NWPCAM utilizes a series of linear models plus Eutro-WASP and Toxi-WASP. These models simulate  the fate and transport of pollutants as they move through the surface water network.   Component 4: Policy/Scenario Definition.   NWPCAM has implemented simplified scenario definitions, such as % change in a pollutant loadings  category as well as definitions for very specific policies, such as proposed guidelines for Meat Processing  plants and complex scenario definitions such as AFO/CAFO.   Component 5: Water Quality Effects.   The water quality effects are related to the policy definitions and reflect the capabilities of the components  1, 2, and 3 to perform the required analyses. For example, NWPCAM?s capabilities to evaluate complex  AFO/CAFO scenarios is a function of the data content of Component 1 and the software tools built into  Components 3 and 4.   Component 6: Economic Benefits (Fig. ES-2).   This component is a primary requirement for NWPCAM capabilities. This component has been used in a  variety of policy analyses for EPA. These analyses include Clean Water Act retrospective, Stormwater  Phase II, AFO/CAFO, and Meat Processing analyses.   ","  The water quality modeling system is made up of several interrelated components. The system is built on a  surface water routing framework that covers virtually the entire inland region of the continental United  States. This framework catalogs where surface waters are located and how they are connected, and it  characterizes the dimensions and flow of water through this network. Therefore, three components of   NWPCAM?the hydrological, hydrodynamic, and surface water transport components?are integrated into  the system through this routing framework.   Pollutant loadings to surface water comprise the fourth major component of the modeling system. This  component defines the location and magnitude of discharges to the surface water network. NWPCAM  includes loadings for a number of conventional and nutrient pollutants. NWPCAM 2.1 also includes  loadings for selected toxic compounds (e.g. mercury). Nutrient and conventional pollutant loadings are  defined for both point and nonpoint sources of water pollution. Toxic pollutant loadings are defined for  point sources only.   The fifth component of the NWPCAM system is the kinetic models. These models include first-order  decay/transformation kinetics. NWPCAM 2.1 has added a more complex kinetics model in the form of the  Water Quality Simulation Program (WASP5) model. The kinetics model incorporates information derived  from the hydrological, hydrodynamic, surface water transport, and loadings components. It simulates how  the selected pollutants are dispersed and transformed throughout the surface water network. The primary  output of the modeling system is instream pollutant concentration across the entire network.

PB 93-144384 and PB 93-144392)   ", , , ,,"  OCD is a Gaussian plume model constructed on the framework of the MPTER model.   Pollutant Types:   OCD may be used to model primary pollutants. Settling and deposition are not treated.   Source-Receptor Relationship:   Up to 250 point sources, 5 area sources, or 1 line source and 180 receptors may be used.  Recommendations for Regulatory Use:   OCD has been recommended for use by the Minerals Management Service for emissions located on  the Outer Continental Shelf (50 FR 12248; 28 March 1985). OCD is applicable for overwater sources  where onshore receptors are below the lowest source height. Where onshore receptors are above the  lowest source height, offshore plume transport and dispersion may be modeled on a case-bycase  basis in consultation with the appropriate reviewing authority (paragraph 3.0(b)).   Plume Behavior:    As in ISC, the basic plume rise algorithms are based on Briggs' recommendations.  "," Horizontal Winds:    Constant, uniform wind is assumed for each hour.  Overwater wind speed can be estimated from overland wind speed using relationship of Hsu (1981).  Wind speed profiles are estimated using similarity theory (Businger, 1973). Surface layer fluxes for  these formulas are calculated from bulk aerodynamic methods.  Vertical Wind Speed: Vertical wind speed is assumed equal to zero.   Horizontal Dispersion:    Lateral turbulence intensity is recommended as a direct estimate of horizontal dispersion. If lateral  turbulence intensity is not available, it is estimated from boundary layer theory. For wind speeds less  than 8 m/s, lateral turbulence intensity is assumed inversely proportional to wind speed.  Vertical Dispersion:    Observed vertical turbulence intensity is not recommended as a direct estimate of vertical  dispersion. Turbulence intensity should be estimated from boundary layer theory as default in  the model. For very stable conditions, vertical dispersion is also a function of lapse rate.  Vertical dispersion may be enhanced because of obstructions near the source. A virtual source  technique is used to simulate the initial plume dilution due to downwash.  Formulas recommended by Pasquill (1976) are used to calculate buoyant plume enhancement.  At the water/land interface, the change to overland dispersion rates is modeled using a virtual  source. The overland dispersion rates can be calculated from either vertical turbulence intensity  or the Pasquill-Gifford coefficients. The change is implemented where the plume intercepts the  rising internal boundary layer.  Chemical Transformation:   Chemical transformations are treated using exponential decay. Different rates can be specified by  month and by day or night.   ","  DiCristofaro, D.C. and S.R. Hanna, 1989. OCD: The Offshore and Coastal Dispersion Model. Volume I:  User's Guide.

 PATCH  , 07/11/2011   ,, PROGRAM TO ASSIST IN TRACKING CRITICAL HABITAT   ,"  PATCH is a spatially explicit, individual-based, life history simulator designed to project populations of  territorial terrestrial vertebrate species through time. PATCH is ideal for investigations involving wildlife  species that are mobile habitat specialists. PATCH's data requirements are minimal. It must be supplied  with habitat maps, specifications for habitat use (territory size and habitat affinity), vital rates (survival and  reproduction), and descriptions of a species movement behavior.   PATCH's principal demographic outputs include several measures of population size as a function of time,  realized survival and fecundity rates (rates that reflect the limitations on a population imposed by habitat  quality and landscape pattern), and assessments of the occupancy rate and source-sink behavior of the  breeding sites present in a landscape.   The PATCH model is under active development, and future versions will be more flexible and better suited  for a large range of species, life histories, landscapes, and stressors.   To this end, the following functionality is being added:   Simulation of species interactions   Co-simulation of male and female populations and their interactions   Scenario-specific life cycle event sequences that are user-defined at run time   The flexibility to use multiple habitat and stressor maps   A mechanism for simulating irregular home ranges or territories   The ability to model wildlife aggregations such as colonies or herds   Explicit inclusion of density dependence effects   ",  ,,  Nathan H.

 PERFUM   , 12/01/2009   ,, Probabilistic Exposure and Risk Model For  Fumigants   ,"  Addresses the issue of bystander exposures to fumigants following agricultural and structural applications.  Following application of fumigants, some of the applied material may volatilize and be transported from  treated fields or structures and be carried offsite causing potential exposure to persons in the vicinity of the  application. The highest exposures tend to be near to treated fields or structures, with the atmosphere  dispersing the and diluting the fumigant gas to lower concentrations as the plume moves away from the  source. The model was developed to address the regulatory need to establish buffer zones for some  fumigants. The purpose of a buffer zone is to define a distance from the edge of the field where the  concentration of the fumigant is at or below a level assumed to be safe.

Fumigants are highly volatile pesticides which have been  demonstrated to move away from the application area after they are emitted into the atmosphere via flux  from treated soil or releases from treated structures or enclosures. PERFUM was developed to address the  issue of establishing buffer distances from the use of fumigant pesticides. Buffer distances are key  management tools for reducing the potential for exposure for those who may live or work near  fumigations. Once emitted into the atmosphere, fumigant emissions are diluted by increasing distances  from the treated source. The buffer represents the distance which is an appropriate health protective  separation for a particular fumigation event. PERFUM was developed to provide risk assessors and risk  managers with a tool for evaluating such situations under a variety of conditions to allow for more informed  risk management decisions.   ","  PERFUM uses the ISCST3 (Industrial Source Complex, Short Term Model, V3) as its core processor as  described in the User Guide. PERFUM allows for distributional and probabilistic analyses of buffer  distances based on actual meteorological data (typically 5 year periods have been used) coupled with  estimates of flux (typically derived from field study data) and established target air concentrations of  concern. Further information can be found in the User Guide.   PERFUM generates a distribution of hourly up to daily average concentrations over a 5-year period that  represents the possible range of downwind concentrations depending on when the fumigant is actually  applied. If one assumes that there is an equal probability of a fumigant application occurring for any day of   the year (a simplification), the daily average concentration distribution generated from a 5-year run could  be used to develop a probability of exposure. One model run is required for each combination of the flux  rate profile, meteorological station, concentration of concern, and field/structure size. Another important  aspect of the PERFUM approach is the use of the actual hourly flux profile from the flux studies.  Specifically, the ISCST3 model allows the flux rate to vary by hour-of-day. Therefore, the flux estimates  from each period of the studies (periods range from 2 to 12 hours) are input into the model for the particular  hour-of day that the period measurement occurred. This allows the model to account for variability in flux  rate. The conditions for dispersion are most conducive during the daytime because of atmospheric heating.  Therefore, the use of flux rates represents an important refinement that will increase the accuracy of the  downwind concentration estimates.   ","  PERFUM was evaluated by the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel in 2004. All information pertaining to  that meeting can be found at: http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/sap/tools/atozindex/perfum.htm   The developers also published the following article: A probabilistic model for acute bystander exposure  and risk assessment for soil fumigants (Atmospheric Environment, Volume 40, Issue 19, June 2006, Pages  3548-3560, Richard Reiss and John Griffin).   ",  PERFUM limitations include the following. The maximum area source size is 120 acres for an agricultural  field. The largest structure which has been evaluated is 10 million cubic feet. The farthest buffer distance  which can be predicted is 1440 meters from the source. PERFUM outputs represent hourly up to daily  exposure profiles and are not compiled to provide multi-day time weighted air concentrations. Air  concentrations are limited to 10 times the rounded threshold concentration.   ,  The Office of Pesticide Programs has used PERFUM to develop its risk assessments for a number of  fumigant pesticides.

 PHAST   , 08/31/2009   ,, PHAST   ,"  The computer program PHAST simulates multi-component, reactive solute transport in three-dimensional  saturated ground-water flow systems. PHAST is a versatile ground-water flow and solute-transport  simulator with capabilities to model a wide range of equilibrium and kinetic geochemical reactions. The  flow and transport calculations are based on a modified version of HST3D that is restricted to constant  fluid density and constant temperature. The geochemical reactions are simulated with the geochemical  model PHREEQC, which is embedded in PHAST.   PHAST is applicable to the study of natural and contaminated ground-water systems at a variety of scales  ranging from laboratory experiments to local and regional field scales. PHAST can be used in studies of  migration of nutrients, inorganic and organic contaminants, and radionuclides; in projects such as aquifer  storage and recovery or engineered remediation; and in investigations of the natural rock-water interactions  in aquifers. PHAST is not appropriate for unsaturated-zone flow, multiphase flow, density-dependent flow,  or waters with high ionic strengths.   A variety of boundary conditions are available in PHAST to simulate flow and transport, including  specified-head, flux, and leaky conditions, as well as the special cases of rivers and wells. Chemical  reactions in PHAST include (1) homogeneous equilibria using an ion-association thermodynamic model;   (2) heterogeneous equilibria between the aqueous solution and minerals, gases, surface complexation sites,  ion exchange sites, and solid solutions; and (3) kinetic reactions with rates that are a function of solution  composition. The aqueous model (elements, chemical reactions, and equilibrium constants), minerals,  gases, exchangers, surfaces, and rate expressions may be defined or modified by the user.  A number of options are available to save results of simulations to output files. The data may be saved in  three formats: a format suitable for viewing with a text editor; a format suitable for exporting to  spreadsheets and post-processing programs; or in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), which is a compressed  binary format. Data in the HDF file can be visualized on Windows computers with the program Model  Viewer and extracted with the utility program PHASTHDF; both programs are distributed with PHAST.   Operator splitting of the flow, transport, and geochemical equations is used to separate the three processes  into three sequential calculations. No iterations between transport and reaction calculations are  implemented. A three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system and finite-difference techniques are used  for the spatial and temporal discretization of the flow and transport equations. The non-linear chemical  equilibrium equations are solved by a Newton-Raphson method, and the kinetic reaction equations are  solved by a Runge-Kutta or an implicit method for integrating ordinary differential equations.   The PHAST simulator may require large amounts of memory and long Central Processing Unit (CPU)  times. To reduce the long CPU times, a parallel version of PHAST has been developed that runs on a  multiprocessor computer or on a collection of computers that are networked. The parallel version requires  Message Passing Interface, which is currently (2004) freely available. The parallel version is effective in  reducing simulation times.   This report documents the use of the PHAST simulator, including running the simulator, preparing the  input files, selecting the output files, and visualizing the results. It also presents four examples that verify   the numerical method and demonstrate the capabilities of the simulator. PHAST requires three input files.  Only the flow and transport file is described in detail in this report. The other two files, the chemistry data  file and the database file, are identical to PHREEQC files and the detailed description of these files is  found in the PHREEQC documentation.

 PROJECT   , 11/18/2009   ,, Evaluating the Out-of-Pocket Costs for a  Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP)   ,"  Since its development in 1993, the PROJECT computer model has been used extensively by EPA staff to  determine the net-present value of a supplemental environmental project (SEP). Under EPA’s SEP Policy,  EPA may mitigate a portion of the civil penalty in consideration of a violator’s agreement to perform a  SEP. EPA enforcement staff use PROJECT in order to determine what a proposed SEP will really cost the  violator. For example, a $100,000 SEP to be completed three years after the penalty is paid costs the  violator far less than $100,000. In such a case, the $100,000 is reduced because of the discounting from  dollars three years from now to current-year dollars. The ""real"" cost of the SEP might be only $85,000.  PROJECT helps EPA staff make that calculation. In addition, if the SEP results in cost savings for the  entity (e.g., a pollution prevention SEP that saves $10,000 per year in materials) then that further reduces  the SEP’s out-of-pocket costs.

 PRZM3  , 08/25/2009   ,, PESTICIDE ROOT ZONE MODEL   ,"  PRZM3 is a modeling system that links two subordinate models - PRZM and VADOFT to predict pesticide  transport and transformation down through the crop root and unsaturated zone. PRZM3 includes modeling  capabilities for such phenomena as soil temperature simulation, volatilization and vapor phase transport in  soils, irrigation simulation, microbial transformation, and a method of characteristics (MOC) algorithm to  eliminate numerical dispersion.   PRZM is a one-dimensional, finite-difference model that accounts for pesticide and nitogen fate in the crop  root zone. PRZM is capable of simulating transport and transformation of the parent compound and as  many as two daughter species.   VADOFT is a one-dimensional finite-element code that solves the Richard's equation for flow in the  unsaturated zone. The user may make use of constitutive relationships between pressure, water content,  and hydraulic conductivity to solve the flow equations. Vadoft may also simulate the fate of two parent and  two daughter products.

 QUAL2E  , 11/16/2009   ,, Enhanced Stream Water Quality   ,"  ***QUAL2E is not included in the current version of BASINS***   QUAL2E is a steady state and quasi-dynamic water quality model for the simulation of point source impact  on water quality including nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, dissolved oxygen and BOD, algae, fecal  coliform, other conservative and non-conservative substances, and temperature and fecal coliform for  steady mean or 7Q10 flow. In the BASINS system, reach flow, reach network, and point source data are  extracted for user selected reach segments and automatically populated in the QUAL2E Windows  interface.  As the QUAL2E water quality model is steady state flow and pollutant load model, the output it produces is  pollutant concentration or flow as a function of distance downstream.   QUAL2E, which can be operated either as a steady-state or as a dynamic model, is intended for use as a  water quality planning tool. The model can be used, for example, to study the impact of waste loads on  instream water quality or to identify the magnitude and quality characteristics of nonpoint waste loads as  part of a field sampling program. The user also can model effects of diurnal variations in meteorological  data on water quality (primarily dissolved oxygen and temperature) or examine diurnal dissolved oxygen  variations caused by algal growth and respiration.   QUAL2E can be used to calculate Waste Load Allocations (WLAs) and/or Total Maximum Daily Loads  (TMDLs), ultimately resulting in permit limits. The Windows interface developed for the QUAL2E model  helps users prepare input files more efficiently. Default values for constants are included in the interface to  provide reasonable numbers with which to begin the modeling. Integrated data manipulation options,  stream network graphics, and plotting capabilities are among the many useful features included in the  QUAL2E Windows interface. Different screens or parts of screens will be active or inactive depending on  the input. This feature reduces the potential for making mistakes during data entry.

 RAIMI AMP   , 07/11/2011   ,, Regional Air Impact Modeling Initiative Air Modeling Preprocessor   ,"  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Region 6 developed AMP under the Regional Air  Impact Modeling Initiative (RAIMI) to meet the functional need of preparing data and input files for use in  the ISCST3 air dispersion model. Other related air modeling processing tools include:  ISCBatch - executes multiple ISCST3 air modeling runs in a single batch run.  AIR2GIS - consolidates the large plot files generated by each ISCST3 run into a single file for each  source to generate the Risk-MAP Node Array Index Table (NAIT).  AMP performs three key functions for air modeling within the RAIMI environment:    Implements site parameter quantification (surface roughness, urban/rural land use) for each emission  source in accordance with RAIMI methods.  Prepares source-specific meteorological files using U.S. EPA Meteorological Processor for  Regulatory Models (MPRM).  Auto-generates air model input files for multiple sources for all four potential contaminant phases to  include source-centered universal grid node array with extracted terrain elevations.  RAIMI Background   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region 6, established the Regional Air Impact  Modeling Initiative (RAIMI) Program as a risk-based prioritization tool and project platform designed to  develop, implement, and track multi-media solutions to environmental problems. RAIMI allows for  region-wide prioritization of the potential for health risks, on a community level of resolution, associated  with exposure from multiple contaminants from multiple sources and through multiple exposure pathways.  The RAIMI platform is a combination of flexible exposure/risk methodologies which depend on the  integrated use of a number of components supported by advanced modeling/software tools.

Airflow surrounding a release is modified from  the regionally measured meteorological data by local land features. Processing large data files of  meteorological, land use and terrain information is time- and computer-intensive, particularly when  assessing releases from hundreds or thousands of sources.   Additionally, automation of precise implementation methods ensures consistency among air modeling  analyses. AMP implements automated data pre-processing to prepare source-specific meteorological and  air model source input files accounting for localized variations in site characteristics.   The RAIMI AMP was developed to automate this process so that it would be practical to air model  hundreds to thousands of sources which could be impacting air quality of a single community.   ","  The three core capabilities of AMP provide the air modeler with a tool to prepare source-specific  meteorological and ISCST3 air model input files to allow for completing the air modeling on numerous  sources (greater than 1000) within a regional or county-wide study area. As each source has unique  surrounding land use, available land use data analyzed using geographic information system (GIS) tools  provides for accurate, repeatable determination of appropriate site parameters that influence the air  dispersion and subsequent disposition of emitted contaminants downwind from a release source. These  parameters may then be integrated with AMP into the MPRM input files for execution of source-specific  meteorological data for a five-year period to satisfy RAIMI requirements. Finally, the location of each  source is combined with surrounding terrain data from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) digital elevation  model (DEM) digital files to build a universal grid node array aligned with the USGS longitude/latitude  specifications for DEM files to complete the creation of the required ISCST3 air model input files for  volatile vapor, particle, particle-bound and mercury vapor phase air modeling.

 RAIMI Data Miner  , 08/31/2009   ,, Regional Air Impact Modeling Initiative Data Miner   ,"  Data Miner is a large client-server database processing system that provides access to large and complex  databases and facilitates the assembly of multi-source emissions inventories to support air dispersion  modeling and risk modeling. U.S. EPA developed Data Miner under the Regional Air Impact Modeling  Initiative (RAIMI) to meet the functional need of accessing large regulatory air emissions databases, such  as the Texas Point Source Database (PSDB). Other database examples include the Toxics Release  Inventory (TRI) and National Emission Inventory (NEI).   Modeling and risk-assessment projects require inspection and analysis of large databases. Due to the  complexity and size of emission databases, it can be difficult or impossible to access critical data and can  take significant time to track down particular details embedded in this mass of information.   To overcome these limitations, EPA developed Data Miner. The server consists of a Relational DataBase  Management System (RDBMS) and is designed to prepare datasets by linking existing databases from  which information must be extracted. The client-side application queries and modifies datasets to generate  custom databases or database outputs.   With Data Miner, you can:   Create and edit database table relationships and views for complete access to all attributes maintained   in the database;   link source-specific parameters necessary for air and risk modeling from multiple database tables   through the Data Organizer component;   and extract the source-specific data sets by constructing and executing simple or complex data   queries in the Query Builder component.

 R-UNSAT  , 08/31/2009   ,, R-UNSAT   ,"  Natural attenuation, a remediation strategy that relies on intrinsic physical, chemical, and biological  processes to decrease contaminant concentrations, is gaining widespread acceptance in aquifer restoration  efforts. The potential for successful remediation by natural attenuation depends on the fate of the organic  constituents of the spilled product. These compounds can dissolve in ground water, adsorb to subsurface  sediments, volatilize and diffuse through the unsaturated zone, or undergo chemical and biological  reactions. Volatilization and biodegradation near the water table are two processes that can contribute  significantly to the natural attenuation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in shallow ground water.  R-UNSAT, a computer model designed for quantifying rates of volatilization and biodegradation of organic  compounds near the water table, was developed and documented by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)  and is available to the public. R-UNSAT also can be applied to other unsaturated-zone transport problems  that involve gas diffusion, such as radon migration, and the deposition of compounds from the atmosphere  to shallow ground water.   R-UNSAT is designed to simulate reactive, multispecies transport in a layered unsaturated zone with  variable moisture content. Two-dimensional (axisymmetric) model equations are solved by using a  finite-difference algorithm. Analytical solutions for simulating one dimensional, vertical transport of a  nonreactive species in a homogeneous unsaturated zone also are provided. Gas transport is based on Fick's  Law of diffusion; therefore, application of R-UNSAT is inappropriate if gas-phase advection is significant  (for example, in soil-vapor extraction applications). R-UNSAT can be applied, however, to simulate  advective transport of compounds in the aqueous phase associated with constant ground-water recharge.  R-UNSAT accounts for equilibrium partitioning of mass among immiscible (the petroleum-product  source), solid, aqueous, and gaseous phases. The immiscible phase is assumed to be stationary and is  modeled as a boundary condition.   ",  ,,  Arthur L.

", , ,  Some prior experience in modeling and atmospheric science is helpful. User should be comfortable  running applications in a Unix/Linux environment. User must be capable of organizing and handling large  data sets.   ,,"  REMSAD is a three-dimensional grid model designed to calculate the concentrations of both inert and  chemically reactive pollutants by simulating the physical and chemical processes in the atmosphere that  affect pollutant concentrations. The basis for the model is the atmospheric diffusion or species continuity  equation. This equation represents a mass balance in which all of the relevant emissions, transport,  diffusion, chemical reactions, and removal processes are expressed in mathematical terms. The REMSAD  system consists of a series of preprocessor programs, the core model, and several postprocessing programs.  The model solves the species continuity equation using the method of fractional steps, in which the  individual terms in the equation are solved separately in the following order: emissions are injected;  horizontal advection/diffusion is solved; vertical advection/diffusion and deposition is solved; and chemical  transformations are performed for reactive pollutants. The model performs this four-step solution procedure  during one half of each advective (driving) time step, and then reverses the order for the following half time  step. The maximum advective time step for stability is a function of the grid size and the maximum wind  velocity or horizontal diffusion coefficient. Vertical diffusion is solved on fractions of the advective time  step to keep their individual numerical schemes stable. A typical advective time step for coarse (50–80 km)  grid spacing is 10–15 minutes, whereas time steps for fine grid spacing (10–30 km) are on the order of a  few minutes.   Model inputs are prepared for meteorological and emissions data for the simulation days. Once the model  results have been evaluated and determined to perform within prescribed levels, a projected emission  inventory can be used to simulate possible policy-driven emission scenarios.   The representation of the various processes in the model is based on current scientific understanding.

EPA's National Risk Management Research Laboratory. The first model,  INDOOR, was designed to calculate the indoor pollutant concentrations from indoor sources. The second  model, EXPOSURE, extended INDOOR to allow calculation of individual exposure. RISK extends  EXPOSURE to allow analysis of individual risk to indoor pollutant sources. The three models were all  developed as tools to carry out the mission of the engineering portion of the EPA's indoor air research  program ""To provide tools necessary to reduce individual exposure and risk to indoor air pollutants.""   The latest published version of the RISK computer model is designed to allow calculation of individual  exposure to indoor air pollutants from sources. The model runs in the MS-Windows operating environment  and is designed to calculate exposure due to individual, as opposed to population, activity patterns and  source use. The model also provides the capability to calculate risk due to the calculated exposure.   The three models reflect the status of EPA source and sink characterization research at the time the models  were written. RISK includes more recent empirical source models and mass-transfer-based source models  in addition to the common first order decay source models used in previous software versions. The  mass-transfer-based source models are particularly useful for gas-phase-limited mass-transfer situations.

All information on sources, sinks, air flow rates, individual activity patterns, type of pollutant,  and risk factors is included in the scenario.   A scenario contains all variable information about the model including ventilation rates, sources and sink  information, activity patterns and room to room air flows.   ","  Model results have been compared to test house data and shown to be in good agreement for selected  variables. Comparison of tracer gas measurements for flow rates has been measured by ASTM  standardized criteria. In addition source models were found to provide good predictions while sink terms  remain a source of uncertainty. Most of these tests have been conducted in the EPA IAQ test house.  Tichenor et al. (1988) provide a full description of the test house.   Two types of experiments have been conducted; one type of experiment used tracer gas with known  emission rates. These experiments test the model's ability to track pollutant transport in the building and to  respond to changes in factors such as room-to-room air flows (due for example to heating and air conditions  (HAC) system operation) and air exchange with the outdoors. The second type of experiment uses real  sources and tests the source and sink models as well as the transport portions of the model.   In setting a standard for this evaluation, ASTM has developed guidelines for comparing model predictions  with data. (ASTM, 1991). The ASTM criteria include:    The slope and intercept of the best fit line between measured and predicted values.  The correlation coefficient between measured and predicted concentrations.  The normalized mean square error (NMSE). The NMSE has a value of 0 when there is perfect  agreement for all pairs of measured and predicted concentrations.  The fractional bias, FB, is used to measure bias. FB ranges from -2 to +2 with a value of 0 indicating  perfect agreement.  ASTM recommends that the model be judged based on all the criteria. It is possible to have an adequate  model even if all the criteria are not met.   model even if all the criteria are not met.

 SCI-GROW  , 08/25/2009   ,, SCREENING CONCENTRATION IN GROUND WATER   ,"  SCI-GROW is a simple, empirically based point estimate model. SCI-GROW estimates are based on the  results of pesticide ground-water monitoring studies conducted in areas where the ground water is less than  30 feet deep and the soil, weather, and overall hydrogeologic environment is such that the ground water is  considered to be highly vulnerable to contamination by certain pesticides applied to the surface.  SCI-GROW is used by EPA's Office of Pesticides as a tier 1 screening model for ground water / drinking  water exposure. SCI-GROW is designed to minimize the amount of analysis required to evaluate pesticides  that are unlikely to reach ground water that could be used as drinking water. When the Agency determines  that the pesticide does not pose a significant risk to human health at the screening concentration returned  by SCI-GROW, then there is no need for further analysis of existing monitoring data, requirements for  forward monitoring to further assess the risk, or higher tier modeling. Conversely, when the SCI-GROW  screening concentration is of concern, additional data analysis and/or new monitoring programs or  modeling may be required to assess the potential risk in detail. The Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP)  does not take significant regulatory action based upon the results of tier 1 screening models.   ",  ,,  Michael R.

In the future, it will in the future be   available here.   ", , , ,,  SCI-GROW is a regression model that relates observed concentrations in ground water considered to be  highly vulnerable to contamination to pesticides.   ,"  SCI-GROW utilizes as a primary source of data for the regression results of prospective ground-water  monitoring studies that were previously required to support the registration of pesticides. In the past, this  was the only way to obtain information on the kinds of concentrations of pesticides that might occur in  highly vulnerable ground water. SCI-GROW regresses this prior experience of observed concentrations of  pesticides previously subjected to these intensive site investigations to the use rate and the soil adsorption  coefficients and degradation rates of the pesticides, SCI-GROW has been secondarily compared to upper  bound concentrations of pesticides observed in large-scale monitoring surveys. The model is based on a  body of experience that has demonstrated that the amount of pesticides that leaches in soils is most  strongly correlated with three parameters: the application rate of the pesticide, the soil adsorption  coefficient, and its degradation rate. Comparisons with monitoring surveys provide support for its utility as  a screening model that provides realistic estimates of concentrations of pesticides that will only be  observed in a very small percentage of drinking water sources that tap ground water that is highly  susceptible to contamination.   The regression for SCI-GROW is not directly based on concentrations observed for pesticides with very  high adsorption coefficients or very rapid degradation rates because these compounds do not leach  significantly and there are no field-scale studies to confirm their occurrence in vulnerable ground water  (which, if true, would probably be at concentrations too low to detect). However, comparisons with large  scale monitoring survey results confirm that SCI-GROW provides an effective screening tool for such  compounds as well.   ","  Model QA/QC assessment has been performed and rests with the OPP/EFED quality control officer.   Performance of SCI-GROW as a screening model has been evaluated by comparisons with large-scale  modeling surveys. The core of the analysis is two large-scale surveys (chosen because of their scope, high  level of characterization of monitoring sites, and quality of residue analysis; other available datasets are  inferior in one or more of these characteristics):   1. USGS' National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program is the most comprehensive monitoring  dataset available for evaluating the ability of SCI-GROW to bound (i.e., provide a screening value that is  modestly higher than observed upper-bound concentrations) the vast majority of concentrations observed in  ground water. The NAWQA dataset is expected to represent ground-water that is in general more  vulnerable to pesticide contamination than most ground water sourced drinking water; many NAWQA  wells that were not drinking water wells were observation wells installed in areas where susceptibility of  the ground water to contamination from nearby pesticide use was expected to be high. Special  characteristics of NAWQA include:  Largest scale study covering a large number of pesticide analytes with realistic detection limits.  Significant attempts to associate the detections with local pesticide use, land use, and hydrogeologic  information.  Multi-year study.    2. The National Alachlor Well Water Survey was a large-scale statistically designed study that focused on  the population of domestic drinking water wells in the United States located adjacent to corn fields highly  likely to be treated with alachlor. Other corn herbicides were also analyzed for in the collected samples.  Special characteristics of NAWWS include:  Largest scale study with specific association of well locations to local use of specific pesticides.  Statistically representative of all domestic drinking water wells in the study area.  To further test the performance of SCI-GROW as a Tier 1 screen, we compared this screening tool to the  results of the National Alachlor Well Water Survey (NAWWS) of approximately 1430 domestic drinking  water wells in the United States all located in corn and soybean production areas where an alachlor use  history had been demonstrated (Holden et al., 1992; Environ. Sci. Technol. 26:935-943). This study was  submitted to EPA as data on the impact of alachlor use on ground water used for drinking water. Four other  herbicides were also analyzed for which also had significant use in the study area: atrazine, metolachlor,  cyanazine, and simazine. The only pesticide for which there was an exceedance of the screening  concentration at the 99.8 percentile level was alachlor; there were no exceedances at the 99.5 percentile  level.   Possible reasons for the few exceedances at the 99.8 percentile level in either the NAWQA or NAWWS  data sets include:  The environmental fate data for these pesticides may not be appropriately representative.    Other factors influence the occurrence of these pesticides in ground water, such as point source  contamination, preferential flow, etc.   ", , ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Confidence intervals cannot be presented for any of the results in this analysis.  Very few CGE models are capable of computing confidence intervals, so this limitation is  currently shared with virtually all CGE models.

While SGM does represent different generation technologies within the electricity sector, it  does not represent peak and base load generation requirements.  SGM does not explicitly model new developments in transportation technologies. These  reductions occur as households alter their demand for motor gasoline and through broad  representations of improvements in motor vehicle fuel efficiency.  The time horizon of SGM (2050), while long from an economic perspective, is short from a climate  perspective.  SGM represents emissions of GHGs, but cannot capture the impact that changes in emissions have  on global GHG concentrations.  SGM does represent the benefits of GHG abatement.  SGM does not incorporate benefit-side effects of reductions in conventional pollutants (SO2, NOx,  and Hg) , such as labor productivity improvements from gains in public health.

This is one aspect of how technical change is  represented in the model. The production dynamics equations also describe how the elasticities of  substitution change as new vintages of capital become old vintages of capital. Households The household  equations describe the supply of labor, the wage rate, household income, household savings, and  household final demand.

Conceptual, mathematical and chemical/physical verification has been performed by model developers.  The SHEDS-Wood methodology was reviewed by the OPP FIFRA SAP in August 2002, and the refined  model applied to a CCA case study. The SHEDS-Wood CCA assessment was presented to and favorably  reviewed by the December 2003 OPP FIFRA SAP. The technical report for this assessment is posted on the  SAP web site for that meeting.

 SNTEMP  , 10/06/2009   ,, STREAM NETWORK TEMPERATURE   ,"  The Stream Network Temperature (SNTEMP) model is a mechanistic, one-dimensional heat transport  formulation that predicts daily mean and maximum water temperature as a function of stream distance and  environmental heat flux. Net heat flux is calculated as the sum of heat to or from long-wave atmospheric  radiation, direct short-wave solar radiation, convection, conduction, evaporation, streamside vegetation  (shading), streambed fluid friction, and the water's back radiation. The heat transport model is based on the  dynamic temperature - steady flow equation and assumes that all input data, including meteorological and  hydrological variables, can be represented by 24-hour averages. The heat flux model includes the  incorporation of groundwater influx.   SNTEMP is applicable to a stream network of any size or order. It includes (1) a solar model to predict the  solar radiation penetrating the water as a function of latitude and time of year, (2) a shade model that  predicts the riparian and topographic shading, (3) algorithms that make meteorological corrections that  predict changes in air temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure as functions of elevations  within the watershed, and (4) regression algorithms that smooth and/or fill missing observed water  temperature measurements. Turbulence is assumed to thoroughly mix the stream both vertically and  transversely. Time steps ranging from one month to one day have been used in SNTEMP.   SNTEMP requires that the spatial layout of the hydrologic network be defined by subdividing it into  stream segments of homogeneous characteristics, such as flow, width, and shading. Each homogeneous  stream segment is described by its length, width, slope, roughness (Manning's n) or travel time, and  shading characteristics. The meteorological influences are described by air temperature, relative humidity,  wind speed, percent possible sun (inverse of cloud cover), and ground-level solar radiation. Water flows  into the segment and groundwater accretions along the segment, along with their temperatures, are also  required inputs.   The Stream Segment Temperature Model (SSTEMP) is a subset of SNTEMP that can be useful in a  scoping mode. Applicable only to a single stream segment and single time period, SSTEMP is  exceptionally easy to use as it is modeled after a simple computer spreadsheet application.

 SWAT2000  , 08/25/2009   ,, SOIL AND WATER ASSESSMENT TOOL 2000   ,"  The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), is a river basin, or watershed, scale model developed to  predict the impact of land management practices on water, sediment and agricultural chemical yields in  large complex watersheds with varying soils, land use and management conditions over long periods of  time. It is a continuous time model, i.e. a long-term yield model and is not designed to simulate detailed,  single-event flood routing.To satisfy these objectives, the model is physically based. Rather than  incorporating regression equations to describe the relationship between input and output variables, SWAT  requires specific information about weather, soil properties, topography, vegetation, and land management  practices occurring in the watershed. The physical processes associated with water movement, sediment  movement, crop growth, nutrient cycling, etc. are directly modeled by SWAT using this input data.  Benefits of this approach are:   Watersheds with no monitoring data (e.g. stream gage data) can be modeled  The relative impact of alternative input data (e.g., changes in management practices, climate,  vegetation, etc.) on water quality or other variables of interest can be quantified.    Some additional attributes of SWAT are that it:   Uses readily available inputs. While SWAT can be used to study more specialized processes such as  bacteria transport, the minimum data required to make a run are commonly available from  government agencies.  Is computationally efficient. Simulation of very large basins or a variety of management strategies  can be performed without excessive investment of time or money.  Enables users to study long-term impacts. Many of the problems currently addressed by users involve  the gradual buildup of pollutants and the impact on downstream water bodies. To study these types of  problems, results are needed from runs with output spanning several decades.

 TDM  , 08/25/2009   ,, TRAVEL DEMAND MANAGEMENT   ,"  The TDM Evaluation Model is a software program that analyzes the vehicle-trip reduction effects of a wide range of travel  demand management strategies. The TDM model has been widely applied throughout the U.S. for the purpose of analyzing  employer based and area wide or government applied strategies. It is widely used to address strategies related to transit  improvement, HOV lanes, carpooling and vanpooling promotion; telecommute and work hour strategies; and pricing and  subsidies.   Baseline travel data requirements include zone-to-zone person and vehicle trip tables for the analysis area (these may be  derived from the regional travel model or constructed from employee commute survey data), or total person and vehicle trips  for an individual site/area. Other data requirements include impacts of strategies on travel time and cost by mode and  descriptions of other (non-time/cost-based) TDM programs. The user has the option to change default parameters affecting  strategy effectiveness.   Strategies that affect the time and/or cost of travel are evaluated using a ""pivot-point"" mode choice model. The pivot point  model is a derivative of the logit mode choice model commonly used in four-step travel demand models. It requires  information on baseline mode shares and changes in travel time or cost. The logit-based pivot point mode choice approach is  consistent with common practice in travel demand forecasting, and capable of analyzing the joint impacts of time and  cost-based strategies. The empirical lookup tables allow for differences in impacts by size and type of employer. Trip-table  inputs allow ""market segmentation"" by origin/destination, and impacts vary for each ""market"" depending upon trip lengths and  starting mode shares.   The efficiency of different strategies modeled in TDM models is determined by the changes in modal share, vehicle-trips,  VMT, average vehicle occupancy and transit ridership. The TDM model does not estimate emissions benefits directly. The  user must apply VMT and/or trip-based emission factors. The default coefficients and data on strategy effectiveness in the  TDM model date from around 1990 or earlier. On the whole, the TDM model is easy-to-use, though some effort is required to  develop inputs in the form of matrices showing the number of trips by mode and the distance between each pair of zones.

 TEAM  , 07/13/2010   ,, Trade and Environment Assessment Model   ,"  TEAM is an input-output framework that is built around emission factors that describe the relationship  between the economic value of output, by economic sector and location, and the quantity of environmental  releases that occur in conjunction with the production activity.

To meet these  objectives, the emission factors are defined:   By specific pollutant/use parameter for air emissions, water pollutant discharges, and energy  use/carbon emissions. TEAM accounts for about 1,100 specific chemicals, chemical groups, and  resource use categories.  For each of 293 4-digit NAICS economic sectors (except for energy use and carbon emissions, for  which more aggregated economic sectors are used).  For each state where economic activity occurs (except for certain energy use or carbon emissions  categories, which are defined at the national level).  TEAM’s emission factors are based on environmental release and resource use inventories compiled by  USEPA, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the U.S. Census Bureau, coupled with economic activity data  compiled in the U.S. Economic Census and the U.S. Agricultural Census, and data published by the U.S.  Department of Energy. Thus, TEAM brings together usually separate data characterizing domestic  economic activity, and environmental releases and resource uses into a single consistent framework in  terms of time period, economic sector classification, and geography.

A background in environmental and  economic policy in order to interpret model inputs and outputs. A Master’s degree in policy or economics  or equivalent work experience is recommended.   ,,"  In developing TEAM, USEPA sought to develop an analytic framework that is capable of addressing, in a  comprehensive and consistent fashion, the environmental effects of trade agreements or other complex  economic events potentially affecting a wide range of industries and environmental media. At the outset,  USEPA outlined several analytic objectives to be accomplished in TEAM. These objectives reflect the  breadth of environmental media, industrial sectors, and geographic locations that might reasonably be  affected by a trade agreement. Key to USEPA’s goals was the ability to assess environmental effects  associated with a wide range of environmental media, including the following environmental release and  resource use categories:   1. Criteria and Hazardous Air Pollutant emissions from stationary and mobile sources;  2. Water pollutant discharges across a wide range of chemical categories;  3. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy consumption; and  4. Energy consumption by fuel type.  For these environmental media, USEPA sought to understand how environmental releases or resource use  would change as the result of the changes in economic activity from a trade agreement or other economic  event. Specifically, USEPA sought to use the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) as  the economic framework for analysis and to be as comprehensive as possible in its coverage of industries  within the NAICS sector framework. The agency also strived to capture the geographical distribution of  environmental effects, in terms of both the specific locations and quantities of changes in environmental  releases from the economic activities affected by a trade agreement.   To meet these objectives, USEPA identified the affected production entity (e.g.,manufacturing facility),  where possible, or the state, as the basic locational unit of analysis for assessing environmental effects of a  trade agreement. Further, to understand how environmental releases might vary across the country, USEPA  sought detailed information on the current patterns of economic activity and environmental releases by  production entity and state as the baseline information from which the environmental effects of a trade  agreement would be analyzed.   USEPA judged that these levels of analytic resolution and analytic coverage – in terms of environmental  effects, economic sectors, and locations of effect – would provide a comprehensive and consistent  screening-level assessment of the U.S. environmental effects of a trade agreement.   ","  As discussed previously, TEAM brings together usually separate data characterizing domestic economic  activity, and environmental releases and resource uses into a single consistent framework, in terms of time  period, economic sector classification, and geography.   For a TEAM analysis, the economic event (such as economic changes resulting from a trade agreement) is  specified as the estimated changes in national economic activity for a given year by economic sector.  TEAM may receive the trade agreement/economic event in its native sector classification framework – i.e.,  4-digit NAICS sector – or in several other economic classification frameworks such as the BEA commodity  codes, which TEAM converts to the NAICS framework. Additionally, TEAM may receive the changes in  economic activity for the primary effect sectors only (e.g., the changes in those economic sectors directly  affected by a trade agreement or other economic event) or for total effect sectors (i.e., the changes the  primary effect sectors plus changes in other sectors linked economically to the primary effect sectors).  When the changes in economic activity are defined in terms of primary effect sectors only, TEAM can  translate these changes into total sector effects using information from the most recent U.S. Input-Output  benchmark accounts tables.   TEAM includes the option to account for total sector changes that occur only in domestic production  activities, through the use of import-adjusted input-output total requirement coefficients. It also includes   the option to account for the different emissions/resource use profile of certain sector inputs (in particular  electricity), based on the geographical distribution of the primary economic impacts using NERC-adjusted  total requirement coefficients. To calculate the changes in environmental releases and resource use, TEAM  multiplies the changes in economic activity by sector times the emission factors for each sector, location,  and environmental release/resource use categories.   TEAM calculates environmental release/resource use and economic data for a combination of individual  facilities and states, but presents the changes and impacts at the geographical level of states. This  framework allows the model to draw on and preserve data available at a high level of detail, while also  allowing aggregation to higher levels.   ","  In preparation for the TEAM peer review, USEPA tasked Abt Associates to test the revised TEAM  framework to verify that the model is working as designed and to explore how the model may help inform  USEPA’s understanding of environmental impacts. To help in defining a test case, USEPA provided links  to several analyses recently conducted by the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) on  the environmental impacts of different climate change-related bills considered by Congress. The analyses  focus specifically on the macroeconomic and GHG emissions impacts of measures included in the bills.  Abt Associates used information provided for the most recent Analysis of the Lieberman-Warner Climate  Security Act of 2008 (Senate Bill S. 2191) to develop scenarios analyzed using TEAM.   Before the tests, Abt Associates had to translate emissions information based on the 35 sectors defined in  OAQPS’ IGEM-35 model into the NAICS framework utilized by TEAM. When the tests were conducted,  TEAM’s estimates of CO2 emissions were close to the IGEM baseline values for the near term scenario  (2007-08). The greatest difference in emissions estimates occurred for the 2012 case. The differences likely  reflected additional information within IGEM about ongoing change in energy intensity, fuel mix, and mix  of economic activity that is not available in TEAM’s static economic and emissions structure baseline. On  the other hand, TEAM also reports emissions and discharge changes for other environmental media,  potentially important outputs that were not reported in the IGEM analysis. TEAM has not been compared  to other models primarily because no other input/output model has been identified that draws together in  one framework all of TEAM’s diverse, multi-media emissions databases. Carnegie Mellon University  developed an input/output framework in the 1990s that utilizes economic and emissions data in a manner  similar to TEAM, but that model is limited in the emissions output that it generates and in the geographic  resolution of that output. Unlike TEAM, the versions of CMU Green Design Institute’s Economic  Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) that are available online report emission results by total  category of releases, such as total toxic releases to land, water, and air. EIO-LCA does not give information  on the release of individual chemicals by air or water, nor does it weight the toxicity of chemical releases or  provide information about releases both by NAICS code AND by every state of the United States.   The most recent EIO-LCA’s model update is to analyze GHG emissions and energy use by unit of  economic activity. This version does provide a level of detail about GHG emissions that TEAM does not  provide—namely, the EIO-LCA estimates GHG emissions at the 6-digit NAICS level, rather than the more  aggregated 4-digit level utilized by TEAM. Several versions of the EIO-LCA model are available at:   http://www.eiolca.net    ","  TEAM is a static model that utilizes 2002 databases for its economic inputs and for most of its  environmental data. As such, it cannot make emission estimates that reflect changes in environmental or  production technologies. TEAM peer reviewers also noted that TEAM’s failure to report results at the  6-digit NAICS level is a shortcoming, because a large variation can occur within the CO2 emissions  reported at the 2-digit and 4-digit level. One reviewer also noted that an advantage to reporting emissions  at the 6-digit level for a trade agreement is that some products show up at the 6-digit level that will not  show up at the 4-digit level.   ","  TEAM has been used in several applications since its first version became available in 2004. Most  recently, the U.S. government utilized the CO2 emission coefficients within TEAM to generate a report,  “The Effects of H.R. 2454 on International Competitiveness and Emission Leakage in Energy-Intensive,  Trade-Exposed Industries . This Dec. 2, 2009 report was written in response to a request from U.S.  Senators Bayh, Specter, Stabenow, McCaskill and Brown. The report examines patterns of energy use,  emissions, and trade across manufacturing sectors to identify vulnerable industries, assesses the potential  impacts of proposed legislation on these industries, and estimates how key allowance allocation provisions  moderate these impacts on costs, trade flows, and ultimately emission leakage. Baseline emission estimates  for key industries were established in part by utilizing coefficients established in TEAM.

 THERDBASE   , 11/16/2009   ,, Total Human Exposure Risk Database and  Advance Simulaiton Environment   ,"  THERdbASE is no longer supported by EPA and is no longer available as download.   THERdbASE is a collection of databases and models that are useful to assist in conducting assessments of  human exposure to chemical pollutants, especially for inhalation exposure to indoor airborne volatile  organic compounds (VOCs). THERdbASE is a user-friendly Windows-type application for personal  computers. It contains eleven (11) different human exposure-related modeling modules and the data  necessary to use these models. The models within THERdbASE, some of which can be run in a  coordinated manner, include the following, with model numbers corresponding to those in THERdbASE:   101. Subsetting Activity Pattern Data  102. Locations Patterns - Simulated  103. Source - Timed Application  104. Source - Instantaneous Application  105. Indoor Air - 2 Zones  106. Indoor Air - N Zones  107. Exposure - Inhalation - BEAM [Benzene Exposure Assessment Model]  108. Exposure - Inhalation - Multiple Chemicals  109. Dose - Dermal - Film Thickness  110. Scenario - Dose - Inhalation/Dermal  201. Soil Exposure/Dose Assessment  Most of the models in THERdbASE can conduct either single-scenario or Monte Carlo simulations. Models  101 and 102 are used to select demographic subpopulations and simulate the activity and location  sequences of people within that subpopulation. Simulations are based on data from human activity surveys.  Those data are stored within datafiles within THERdbASE. Models 103 and 104 simulate the release of  volatile organic compounds, over either a user-selected period of time, or in an instantaneous release,  respectively, into indoor air. Models 105 and 106 simulate the airborne concentrations of VOCs in  multi-zone indoor environments. The simulated VOCs are those whose emissions were simulated in  Models 103 and 104. Models 107 and 108 simulate the inhalation exposure to benzene or other VOCs,  respectively, of people as they inhabit multiple environments as defined by their location and activity  patterns. Model 109 simulates peoples' dermal (skin) exposure to chemicals. Model 110 combines  inhalation and dermal exposure simulations. Model 201 simulates exposure to chemical contaminants on  soil.   A significant limitation of THERdbASE is the limited ability of users to import their own data. Many of  the models are constrained to using the existing databases that are also a built-in part of THERdbASE.   THERdbASE was created as a research and development prototype of a user-friendly software system for  linking data and models in performing human exposure and risk assessments. No further versions or  improvements to THERdbASE are planned by the EPA.   The next generation of EPA's human exposure data will be made available in an Internet-accessible system  referred to as HEDS, the Human Exposure Data System. HEDS will not contain exposure models.

Each exposure event places the individual in contact with one or more  pollutants within a microenvironment (e.g., inside a home, along a road, inside a vehicle). In addition to the  location assignments, the exposure event can also provide information relating to the potential for pollutant  uptake (e.g., respiration rate).

That is,  all inputs and outputs of the chemical of interest are tracked to ensure that the results are not unrealistic  with regard to the relationship between the amount of that chemical being introduced to the system and the  amounts predicted to be retained in and lost from the system. More specifically, it means that the amounts  of the chemical of interest predicted to be retained in and lost from the system always sum to the amount of  chemical introduced into the system. When applied to a specific compartment (e.g., soil, or a mouse  population), the mass balance approach implies that, over a given time period, the amount of the chemical  of interest in the compartment at the end of the period is equal to the sum of the amount of that chemical in  the compartment at the beginning of the period plus the gains of the chemical that occurred during the time  period, minus the chemical that was lost from the compartment during the time period.   ","  The evaluation activities performed to date for TRIM.FaTE correspond to different (but overlapping) types  of model evaluation activities:    Conceptual model evaluation;  Mechanistic and data quality evaluation;  Structural evaluation; and  Performance evaluation.  The first three evaluation activities primarily focus on the information that goes into the model (e.g., theory  and data); how this information is synthesized (e.g., process models, algorithms, and assumptions); and  how the finished model is set up (e.g., appropriate level of complexity). The fourth evaluation activity  focuses mainly on the information that comes out of the model (e.g., comparing overall model outputs to  various kinds of benchmarks). Detailed methods and resultsof the first three evaluation types are presented  in Volume I of the Evaluation Report. (PDF 966 KB, 158 pages, info about PDF). The initial performance  evaluation activities for TRIM.FaTE are presented in Volume II.   The model evaluation plan for TRIM.FaTE was designed at the output to be flexible. Results from the  TRIM.FaTE evaluation efforts have posed new questions and led to additional review, analysis, and testing.  The various evaluation activities performed on TRIM.FaTE increase the experience and understanding that  will ultimately lead to a judgment about its quality, reliability, relevance, and acceptability There has been  substantial progress on a number of these activities (e.g., code verification, model documentation, peer  review, mechanistic evaluation of individual process models and algorithms). Progress has also been made  on other evaluation activities (e.g., complexity analyses, overall performance evaluation, including  sensitivity/uncertainty analyses), which will continue with new applications and various analyses.   ","  TRIM.FaTE at its core is a very flexible model. Limitations to any one simulation relates predominantly to  limitations with the user’s “library”, which contains the algorithms and input values for the modeling   “scenario”. Some reference libraries are available on the TRIM.FaTE web site, but the user has the  responsibility for confirming their suitability for the user’s application and the user can augment or revise  as needed. For example, to the extent the input data for a particular transfer process is of an annual scale  rather than a daily scale or includes only adult fish vs juveniles, interpretation of the the model outputs will  carry that same limitation.   As the main purpose for development of TRIM.FaTE has been for assessment of the multimedia  distribution of those air pollutants with a tendency to accumulate in nonair media, it is not well suited for  detailed air dispersion modeling for which other air-specific models are available.

 UAM-V v1.50  , 08/31/2009   ,, Urban Airshed Model-V v1.50   ,"  The UAM-V Model is a three-dimensional, multi-scale photochemical grid model that calculates  concentrations of pollutants by simulating the physical and chemical processes in the atmosphere. The  model is the latest of the Urban Airshed Model (UAM) lineage, which was initiated in the early 1970s and  has undergone nearly continuous cycles of application, performance evaluation, update, extension, and  improvement. The basis for the UAM is the atmospheric diffusion or species continuity equation. This  equation represents a mass balance that includes all of the relevant emissions, transport, diffusion, chemical  reactions, and removal processes in mathematical terms. Because it accounts for spatial and temporal  variations as well as differences in the reactivity of emissions, the UAM is ideal for evaluating the  air-quality effects of emission control scenarios. It does this by first replicating a historical ozone episode to  establish a base-case simulation. Model inputs are prepared from observed meteorological, emission, and  air quality data for the episode days using prognostic meteorological modeling and/or diagnostic and  interpolative modeling techniques. The model is then applied with these inputs, and the results are  evaluated to determine its performance. Once the model results have been evaluated and determined to  perform within prescribed levels, the same base-case meteorological inputs are combined with projected  emission inventories to simulate possible future emission scenarios.   The model contains the following features: capability of simulating multiple nested grids of variable  resolution, two-way communication between nested grids, multiple coordinate system capabilities, and  plume-in-grid (PiG) treatment. The UAM-V also includes Process Analysis capabilities that allow the user  to quantify the contributions from the physical and chemical processes to simulated concentrations in  selected grid cells. The model employs the Carbon Bond V chemical kinetics mechanism, an updated  version CB-IV mechanism (Gery, at al., 1989). The UAM-V has been applied to simulate tropospheric  ozone concentrations on multiple scales for a range of time periods (days, months, seasons, year). The  model requires input data specifying the emissions and initial and boundary concentrations of gaseous  precursors of ozone (VOC, NOx, and CO). The model also requires a full set of three-dimensional  meteorological inputs, which can be provided by dynamic meteorological models (such as MM5) or  diagnostic models (such as DWM). The UAM-V also has the capability of running without photochemistry  (nonreactive), to simulate urban- or regional-scale CO concentrations.   UAM-V includes the Ozone and Precursor Tagging Methodology (OPTM) which allows estimates of  source contributions to ozone formation to be made during a simulation.   ",  ,,  Sharon Douglas  ICF International  sdouglas@icfi.com  415 507-7108   Information is also available through EPA's Support Center for Regulatory Atmospheric Modeling website  at http://www.epa.gov/scram001/photochemicalindex.htm    , , , http://www.uamv.com    , Latest version includes the Carbon Bond V  chemical mechanism and OPTM for  estimating source contributions to ozone.   , ,,,"  PC or Workstation, 100 Mb memory, 20 Gb disk space   ",  Unix/Linux   ,  Fortran 77   ,,  www.uamv.com   ,,"  Meteorological data required by the model include hourly, three-dimensional inputs of horizontal winds,  temperature, pressure, water vapor, and vertical turbulent exchange coefficients. Hourly, gridded  two-dimensional inputs are required for: landuse, total ozone column, turbidity, and albedo. In addition, the  model requires information regarding the heights (above ground) of the specific layers used in the  simulation and the pressure at the layer midpoints. Estimates of cloud cover, liquid water concentration,  and rainfall rate are optional.   Air quality data are required to specify the initial concentration fields and the concentrations along the  boundaries (top and lateral) of the modeling domain.   The emission inputs include gridded, hourly estimates of gaseous species required by the CB-IV, including  speciated hydrocarbons (VOC), NOx as NO and NO2, and CO for all anthropogenic and biogenic sources.  The model requires specific source information for stationary sources, including stack location coordinates,  height, diameter, exit velocity, and exit temperature for calculating plume rise. For CO modeling, sources  of CO emissions are all that is required.   Other input requirements of UAM-V include the chemical reaction rates file, a file that specifies the  selected cell aggregation and grid nesting attributes, and a file that specifies the attributes of the simulation,  including grid definition, time step, output options (such as Process Analysis), and other options.   ","  The output provided by the UAM-V model includes a three-dimensional array of pollutant concentrations  for all species simulated in two files: an average file provides hourly (or other averaging period specified  by the user) concentrations that are an average of the concentrations at each advection time step; and an  instantaneous file, that provides concentration fields at the beginning of the hour (or other user-specified  time period). The model also provides a full list of input specifications, including emission summaries,  mass fluxes across boundaries, history of the simulation, and a record of useful diagnostic parameters for  each time step of the simulation.   ",,  www.uamv.com   , , ,  Some prior experience in modeling and atmospheric science is helpful. User should be comfortable  running applications in a Unix/Linux environment. User must be capable of organizing and handling large  data sets.   ,,"  UAM-V is a three-dimensional grid model designed to calculate the concentrations of the chemically  reactive species involved in the formation of urban smog. It is also capable of calculating the  concentrations of inert species such as CO. The basis for the model is the atmospheric diffusion or species  continuity equation. This equation represents a mass balance in which all of the relevant emissions,  transport, diffusion, chemical reactions, and removal processes are expressed in mathematical terms. The  model solves the species continuity equation using the method of fractional steps, in which the individual  terms in the equation are solved separately. The maximum advective time step for stability is a function of  the grid size and the maximum wind velocity or horizontal diffusion coefficient. Vertical diffusion is solved  on fractions of the advective time step to keep their individual numerical schemes stable. A typical  advective time step for an urban scale (4 km) grid spacing is 2–5 minutes.   Model inputs are prepared for meteorological and emissions data for the simulation days. Once the model  results have been evaluated and determined to perform within prescribed levels, a projected emission  inventory can be used to simulate possible policy-driven emission scenarios.   The representation of the various processes in the model is based on current scientific understanding.   References are given in the User’s Manual.   ","  Emissions    Anthropogenic and biogenic emissions are spatially allocated and provided to the model in gridded form.  The emissions are temporally allocated throughout the simulation period to emulate the temporal features of  the total daily emissions. Sources with no (or small) plume rise are injected into the first layer of the model.  Emissions of sources with plume rise are emitted into the upper layers of the model, depending on the  hourly effective plume rise. Specific sources can also be treated (user-specified) with a subgrid-scale  plume-in-grid algorithm, which better treats the diffusion, transport, and chemistry of the emissions by  minimizing near-source dispersion.   Concentrations    Concentrations of each pollutant are calculated for all grid cells within the modeling domain. The Process  Analysis feature allows the user to quantify the contribution of the physical and chemical processes to the  concentration in one or more cells.

Systems Applications International, San Rafael, California.   Key Limitations to Model Scope   Plume Behavior   The plume rise for user-specified sources is calculated based on the plume rise treatment developed for the  Gaussian dispersion model TUPOS (Turner et al., 1986). For user-specified sources, the dispersion,  diffusion, chemical transformation, and transport of emissions are calculated with the Plume-in-Grid  algorithm. Emissions are released from the source in a series of “puffs”. When the user-specified plume  size in the puff is equal to a portion of the grid cell, the plume mass is injected into and handled henceforth  by the grid model.   Horizontal Winds   The UAM-V requires gridded, three-dimensional winds in the form of u and v components, which must be  specified either at each grid cell center or staggered to horizontal cell interfaces.   Vertical Wind Speed   The UAM-V model calculates vertical winds at each layer interface using the mass-continuity relationship  using the horizontal wind components.   Case Studies   Horizontal Dispersion   Horizontal diffusivities are calculated with the UAM-V based on deformation characteristics of the  horizontal wind (Smagorinsky, 1963).   Vertical Dispersion   Vertical turbulent exchange coefficients are estimated using either output from a prognostic meteorological  model, such as MM5, or a preprocessor that utilizes gridded UAM-V input wind and temperature  information.   Chemical Transformation   The UAM-V uses Version V of the Carbon Bond Mechanism (CB-V).   Removal Processes   The UAM-V dry deposition algorithm is based on a scheme by Wesely (1989), where the deposition  velocity is a function of aerodynamic, boundary layer, and surface resistance. The aerodynamic resistance  is dependent on the surface characteristics and atmospheric stability conditions. The boundary or  quasilaminar resistance represents the process of molecular diffusion of the transport of pollutant around  solid objects and is dependent on the ratio of the air kinematic viscosity to the molecular diffusivity. The  surface resistance is a set of resistances associated with vegetation types and surface soil, litter, and water,  and are derived based on the input land use characteristics. Wet deposition, which is optional, calculates  the removal of aerosol and soluble gas species using gridded, hourly rainfall rates.

 UR3M  , 08/31/2009   ,, UNIFIED RADON RELATIVE RISK MODEL   ,"  The Unified Radon Relative Risk Model (UR3M) is a Windows program for PCs. It was developed to fill  the need for a comprehensive approach to radon health risks and to allow users or their clients to make  informed decisions with respect to radon. The model combines three radon sources, three exposure  pathways, and two risk reduction methods to give a composite assessment of health risks, attainable risk  reductions, and cost factors associated with risk reduction. Risks are presented both numerically and  graphically, calculated for the general population according to environmental factors. Individuals may  customize their risk estimate based on their smoking histories.

It accomplishes this in two ways. First, through selection of the focus of the risk estimate to either the  individual houses or to multiple house groups, including all significant risk parameters. Second, by  presenting risks graphically as personalized bar graphs, much of the communication barrier between the  scientific-technical community and the public can be overcome.

 VS2DI  , 08/31/2009   ,, VS2DI   ,"  VS2DI is a graphical software package for simulating flow and transport in variably saturated porous  media. This software package consists of three components:   VS2DTI, for simulating fluid flow and solute transport   VS2DHI, for simulating fluid flow and energy (heat) transport   A standalone postprocessor, for viewing results saved from previous simulation runs.   Both VS2DTI and VS2DHI combine a graphical user interface with a numerical model to create an  integrated, window-based modeling environment. Users can easily specify or change the model domain,  hydraulic and transport properties, initial and boundary conditions, grid spacing, and other model  parameters. Simulation results can be displayed as contours of pressure head, moisture content, saturation,  concentration or temperature, and velocity or flux for each time step, thus creating a simple animation.   The numerical models used for flow and transport calculations are the U.S. Geological Survey's computer  models VS2DT (for solute transport) and VS2DH (for energy transport). VS2DT is a finite-difference  model that solves Richard's equation for fluid flow, and the advection-dispersion equation for solute  transport.   The model can analyze problems in one or two dimensions using either cartesian or radial coordinate  systems. Relations between pressure head, moisture content, and relative hydraulic conductivity may be  represented by functions developed by van Genuchten, Brooks and Corey, Haverkamp and others, or by  data points. Initial hydraulic condition can be specified as static equilibrium, specified pressure head, or  specified moisture content. Boundary conditions include specified pressure or total head, specified flux,  infiltration with ponding, evaporation, plant transpiration, and seepage faces. Solute transport processes  include advection, dispersion, first-order decay, adsorption, and ion exchange.   VS2DH is a version of VS2DT that has been modified to simulate energy transport instead of solute  transport. Both VS2DT and VS2DH are written in Fortran 77.

""Analytic Element Modeling of Groundwater Flow"" by H. M. Haitjema,  Academic Press, 1995, provides the basic theoretical framework for the analytic element method and  focuses on its use.   This new method avoids the discretization of a groundwater flow domain by grids or element networks.  Instead, only the surface water features in the domain are discretized, broken up in sections, and entered  into the model as input data. Each of these stream sections or lake sections are represented by closed form  analytic solutions: the analytic elements. The comprehensive solution to a complex, regional groundwater  flow problem is obtained by superposition of all, a few hundred, analytic elements in the model.   Traditionally, superposition of analytic functions was considered to be limited to homogeneous aquifers of  constant transmissivity. However, by formulating the groundwater flow problem in terms of appropriately  chosen discharge potentials, rather than piezometric heads, the analytic element method becomes  applicable to both confined and unconfined flow conditions as well as to heterogeneous aquifers.   The analytic elements are chosen to best represent certain hydrologic features. Areal recharge is modeled   by areal source distributions (areal sinks with a negative strength). Streams and lakes that are not fully  connected to the aquifer are modeled by line sinks or area sinks with a bottom resistance. Discontinuities in  aquifer thickness or hydraulic conductivity are modeled by use of line doublets.

 WHATIF   , 07/11/2011   ,, Watershed Health Assessment Tools Investigating Fisheries   ,"  WHATIF is software that integrates a number of calculators, tools, and models for assessing the health of  watersheds and streams with an emphasis on fish communities. The tool set consists of hydrologic and  stream geometry calculators, a fish assemblage predictor, a fish habitat suitability calculator,  macro-invertebrate biodiversity calculators, and a process-based model to predict biomass dynamics of  stream biota (the BASS model).   The software is built upon a database of stream measurements which serve as inputs to the calculators and  tools. The calculators and tools vary in complexity, and can take the form of regression-based predictions  up to a process based fish population model, the Bioaccumulation and Aquatic System Simulator (BASS).  The toolkit allows the user to investigate a location on a stream or river by examining the data that have  been collected at the location, and using the data with the calculators to compare actual conditions with  predicted or possible conditions.   For example, the Fish Assemblage Predictor might indicate that a stream in this location would likely  support a trout population, while the data show that no trout have been observed. Then, the Habitat  Suitability calculator could be used to examine the scores for trout to see if an explanation can be found in  the current stream conditions. The user could explore what changes could be made to the stream, such as  overhanging vegetation or erosion control, to allow trout to thrive. Finally, trout could be ""stocked"" in the  simulation model to see if they persist and how other species are affected.   All of the data, both original observations and user-generated experimental data, are stored in the central  database which allows access by any WHATIF tool or calculator. Thus, the output of one tool can become  the input of another tool, and this feature is exploited by some calculators and tools with certain kinds of  data.
