The name derives from the geomorphologist Grove Karl Gilbert [.pdf], but the term ""club"" is whimsical as Gilbert Club is not itself an organization and there is no membership. Gilbert Club was simply conceived as an opportunity for a growing community to hear major talks, debate new ideas, and encourage community level discussion of issues. The goal is to have faculty, students, government researchers and industry workers meet regularly to spawn collaborations and, frankly, to encourage friendships, on an annual basis.  It has always been an open meeting, first advertised through paper mailings and now through email.  In recent years attendance has approached 300. We normally have just three or four 50-minute presentations, followed by 20 minutes of discussion and debate. During the last hour or more, depending on how well we keep on schedule, we have ""pop ups,"" during which brief (a few minutes) presentations are made by whomever wishes to do so.
